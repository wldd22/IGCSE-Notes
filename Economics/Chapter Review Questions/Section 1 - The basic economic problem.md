2) **What is the difference between a need and a want?**
	- Needs are goods and services that are essential for survival, like nutritional food, clean water, and shelter. Meanwhile, wants are goods and services that are not necessary for survival.
3) **What is meant by the basic economic problem?**
	- The basic economic problem is how to allocate scarce resources to satisfy people's unlimited needs and wants as efficiently as possible.
4) **What is meant by economic agents?**
	- Economic agents are the decision makers of an economy. They produce and consume goods and services.
5) **What are the three fundamental questions that all economies face?**

	- For whom to produce?
6) **What is the difference between goods and services?**
	- Goods are physical items that can be produced, bought, and sold, like furniture, clothing, and stationary. Meanwhile, services are Intangible items that be provided and paid for, like haircuts, education, and concerts.
7) **What is the difference between the private and public sector?**
	- The private sector consists of the economic activity of private individuals and firms. Its main aim is to earn profit for its owners. Meanwhile, the public sector consists of economic activity directly involving the government. Its main aim is to provide a service.
8) **How do economic goods differ from free goods?**
	- Economic goods are goods that are limited in supply, like oil, wheat, and cotton. Meanwhile, free goods are goods that are unlimited in supply, like air, seawater, and sunlight.

## Chapter 2: The factors of production

1) **What is meant by the term ‘factors of production’?**
	- Factors of production comprise of the resources required to produce a good or service
2) **What are the four factors of production?**
	- The four factors of production are land, labour, capital, and enterprise.
3) **What are the various rewards for the factors of production?**
	- Land - Rent
	- Labour - Wages and salaries
	- Capital - Interest
	- Enterprise - Profit
4) **What is the collective name for the four returns on the factors of production?**
	- The collective name for the four returns on the factors of production is income.
5) **What is meant by the mobility of factors of production?**
	- The mobility of factors of production is the extent to which factors of production (usually labour) can be changed for one another in the production process.
6) **How does geographical mobility of factor resources differ from occupational mobility?**
	- Geographical mobility is defined as the extent to which labour is willing and able to move to different locations for employment purposes. Meanwhile, occupational mobility is the extent to which labour is able to move between jobs.
7) **What are the various causes of changes in the quantity and quality of factors of production?**
	- Changes in the quantity and quality of factors of production can arise due to various causes. Higher costs, such as increased labour costs from a national minimum wage, reduce demand for labour, while government policies like taxes, subsidies, and regulations influence production costs and incentives to work.

## Chapter 3: Opportunity cost

1) **How is the term 'opportunity cost' defined?**
	- Opportunity cost is the cost of the next best opportunity forgone when making a decision.
2) **What might be the opportunity cost of a student studying IGCSE Economics?**
	- The opportunity cost of choosing to study IGCSE Economics is another IGCSE subject they could be studying instead.
3) **Why do consumers face opportunity costs in decision making?**
	- Consumers have limited incomes, so whenever they purchase a particular good or service, they give up the benefits of purchasing another product.
4) **Why do workers face opportunity costs in decision making?**
	- Workers tend to specialise in jobs. By choosing to specialise in a particular profession, workers give up the opportunity to pursue other jobs and careers.
5) **Using an example, explain why producers (firms) face opportunity costs in decision making.**
	- Producers need to choose between competing business opportunities. For example, a company like Apple needs to choose between whether to put more money into developing the new iPhone or new MacBook.
6) **Using an example, explain why governments face opportunity costs in decision making.**
	- Governments need to choose where to allocate resources and money to achieve the best outcome. For example, if a government spends a lot of money repairing an old road, they can't use that money on something else, like constructing a new hospital.

## Chapter 4: Production possibility curve

1) **What is meant by productive capacity?**
	- Productive capacity is the maximum combination of goods or services possible to produce in an economy.
2) **What does a production possibility curve diagram show?**
	- The production possibility curve shows the productive capacity, at a point of time.
3) **How is the concept of opportunity cost shown on a PPC diagram?**
	- Movements along the PPC incur an opportunity cost.
4) **Which two conditions must hold for an economy to be operating on its PPC?**
	- When an economy is on the PPC, that means all its resources are being used (there is no unemployment of factors of production) and that there is efficiency in the use of resources (factors of production are allocated to their best use/purpose)
5) **What are the causes of a shift of the PPC?**
	- An outward shift is caused by an increase in quantity and/or quality of the factors of production. An inward shift is caused by a decrease in quantity and/or quality of the factors of production.
