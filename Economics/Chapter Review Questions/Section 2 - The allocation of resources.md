## Chapter 5: Microeconomics and macroeconomics

1) **What is meant by microeconomics?**
	- Microeconomics is the study of particular markets and sections of the economy, rather than the economy as a whole.
2) **What is meant by macroeconomics?**
	- Macroeconomics is the study of economic behaviour and decision-making of the whole economy, rather than individual markets.
3) **Who are the main decision makers in microeconomics, and how does this differ from the decision makers in macroeconomics?**
	- Microeconomics is concerned with decision making by individuals, households, and firms, while, macroeconomics is concerned with decision making for the economy as a whole.
4) **Who are the decision makers affected by microeconomics?**
	- Microeconomics affects decision makers such as individuals, households, and firms
5) **Who are the decision makers affected by macroeconomics?**
	- Macroeconomics affects decision makers such as governments, the population as a whole, and international organizations.

## Chapter 6: The role of markets in allocating resources

1) **What is meant by the market system?**
	- The market system refers to the method of allocating scarce resources through the market forces of demand and supply.
2) **What is meant by market equilibrium?**
	- Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers at a specific price, resulting in no surplus or shortage.
3) **How does market disequilibrium occur?**
	- Market disequilibrium occurs when the price is either above or below the equilibrium price, leading to either excess supply or excess demand.
4) **What are the three key economic questions that all economies must address?**
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
5) **What is the price mechanism?**
	- The price mechanism is the system where the forces of demand and supply interact to determine prices and allocate resources without government intervention​
6) **What are the key features of the price mechanism?**
	- *No government interference* in economic activity
	- The *allocation of resources* being *based on price and financial incentives*
	- *Competition* that creates choice and opportunities for firms and private individuals

## Chapter 7: Demand

1) **What is meant by demand?**
	- Demand refers to both the willingness and ability of customers to pay a given price to buy a good or service
2) **What is the law of demand?**
	- The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded. As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa
3) **What are the two reasons for the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded?**
	- When the price of a good or service falls, the customer is able to buy of the product for the same cost
	- When the price of a good or service rises, the customer is able to buy of the product for the same cost
4) **What are the main determinants of demand?**
	- Habits, fashions, and tastes
	- Income
	- Substitutes and complements
	- Advertising
	- Government policies
	- Economy
5) **How does a movement along a demand curve differ from a shift in the demand curve?**
	- A movement along the demand curve occurs due to a change in the price of the product, while a shift in the demand curve happens due to changes in non-price factors like income or preferences
6) **How does a contraction in demand differ from an extension in demand?**
	- A contraction in demand refers to a fall in the quantity demanded following a price increase, while an extension in demand refers to an increase in quantity demanded following a price reduction
7) **What is meant by market demand?**
	- Market demand is the total of all individual demand for a product at each price level
8) **How does a fall in quantity demanded differ from a fall in demand?**
	- A fall in quantity demanded is caused by an increase in the price of the product, leading to movement along the demand curve. A fall in demand, however, is caused by changes in non-price factors, resulting in a leftward shift of the demand curve​

## Chapter 8: Supply

1) **What is meant by supply?**
	- Supply refers to the ability and willingness of firms to provide goods and services at given price levels
2) **Why is the supply curve upward sloping?**
	- The supply curve is upward sloping because there is a positive relationship between price and the quantity supplied. As prices increase, firms are more willing to supply more to maximize profits
3) **What are the main determinants of supply?**
	- Price
	- Time
	- Weather
	- Opportunity cost
	- Taxes
	- Innovations
	- Production costs
	- Subsidies
4) **What is the law of supply?**
	- The law of supply states that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied. As the price increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa
5) **How does a contraction in supply differ from an extension in supply?**
	- A contraction in supply occurs when the quantity supplied decreases due to a fall in price, while an extension in supply occurs when the quantity supplied increases due to a price rise
6) **How does market supply differ from individual supply?**
	- Individual supply refers to the supply provided by a single firm at each price level, while market supply is the total supply of a product provided by all firms in the market at each price level
7) **What is the difference between a movement along a supply curve and a shift in a supply curve?**
	- A movement along the supply curve is caused by a change in the price of the good, while a shift in the supply curve occurs due to changes in non-price factors like production costs or technological advances
8) **What are the causes of shifts in the supply curve?**
	- A change in non-price factors affecting the supply of a good or service will cause a shift in the supply curve

## Chapter 9: Price determination

1) **What is meant by market equilibrium?**
	- Market equilibrium is the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, resulting in no excess demand or supply
2) **What is meant by equilibrium price?**
	- The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded by customers equals the quantity supplied by suppliers
3) **What is meant by market disequilibrium?**
	- Market disequilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are not equal, leading to shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply)​
4) **What is the difference between excess demand and excess supply?**
	- Excess demand occurs when the price is below equilibrium, causing more demand than supply. Meanwhile, excess supply occurs when the price is above equilibrium, leading to more supply than demand
5) **When do surpluses occur?**
	- Surpluses occur when the price of a good is set above the equilibrium price, causing supply to exceed demand
6) **When do shortages occur?**
	- Shortages occur when the price is set below the equilibrium price, causing demand to exceed supply

## Chapter 10: Price changes

1) **Which factors cause a change in the equilibrium price and quantity traded?**
	- Changes in non-price factors that affect demand or supply will cause a change in the equilibrium price and quantity
2) **What is the consequence of sales taxes on equilibrium price and quantity?**
	- The imposition of a sales tax shifts the supply curve to the left, leading to an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the quantity traded
4) **What is the impact of favourable weather conditions on the equilibrium price and quantity of agricultural output?**
	- Favourable weather conditions shift the supply curve for agricultural products to the right, reducing the equilibrium price and increasing the quantity traded
5) **State three factors that can shift the demand curve.**
	- Habits, fashions, and tastes
	- Income
	- Substitutes and complements
6) **State three factors that can shift the supply curve.**
	- Time
	- Weather
	- Opportunity cost

## Chapter 11: Price elasticity of demand

1) **What is meant by price elasticity of demand (PED) and how is it calculated?**
	- Price elasticity of demand (PED) is the degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a product following a change in its price. It is calculated using the formula $E_D = \frac{\%ΔQ_D}{\%ΔP}$
2) **Why should firms raise prices for products with price inelastic demand, and reduce prices for products with price elastic demand?**
	- When demand is price inelastic, firms increasing their prices will not decrease demand too much and the overall sales revenue will increase. When demand is price elastic, firms decreasing their prices will increase demand quickly so their sales revenue will increase.
3) <b style="opacity:0.5">Use a diagram to show the difference between perfectly price elastic demand, unitary PED and price inelastic demand.</b>
4) **What are the key determinants of PED?**
	- The key determinants of PED are time, habits and tastes, income and substitution.
5) **How might knowledge of PED be of value to producers (firms)?**
	- Firms can choose to change their prices based on the PED to increase their overall sales revenue.
6) **How might knowledge of PED be of value to the government?**
	- The government can use their knowledge of the PED of certain goods to determine their taxation policies. For example, increasing taxes on demerit goods.

## Chapter 12: Price elasticity of supply

1) **What is meant by price elasticity of supply (PES) and how is it calculated?**
	- Price elasticity of supply (PES) is the degree of responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a product following a change in its price. It is calculated using the formula $E_S = \frac{\%ΔQ_S}{\%ΔP}$
2) <b style="opacity:0.5">Use a diagram to show the difference between perfectly price elastic supply, unitary PES, and price inelastic supply.</b>
3) <b style="opacity:0.5">Use a diagram to distinguish between price elastic PES and price inelastic PES.</b>
4) **What are the key determinants of PES?**
	- The key determinants of PES are spare capacity, inventory (stock) levels, the number of firms in the industry, the ease and the cost of factor substitution, and the time period.
5) **If a product has a PES value of $0$, what does this actually mean? What about $\text{PES}=1$ and $\text{PES}=\infty$?**
	- A PES value of $0$ means the supply is perfectly price inelastic, that is, a change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied.
	- A PES value of $1$ means the supply has unitary price elasticity, that is, the percentage change in the quantity supplied is proportional to the change in price.
	- A PES value of $\infty$ means the supply is perfectly price elastic, that is, the quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.
6) **What is the difference between perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic supply?**
	- A PES that is perfectly price inelastic means that a change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied. Meanwhile, a PES that is perfectly price elastic means that the quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.
7) **How might knowledge of PES be of value to producers (firms)?**
	- Producers can use PES to plan production and manage inventory effectively, particularly for goods with inelastic supply, where responding to price changes takes time. It helps them set pricing strategies, maximizing profit when supply is inelastic and adjusting quickly when supply is elastic. Additionally, PES helps manage risks during market changes, ensuring efficient responses to demand fluctuations. Firms can also use PES to decide on entering markets or developing products where supply flexibility offers competitive advantages.
8) **How might knowledge of PES be of value to the government?**
	- The government can use PES to predict the effects of taxation and subsidies, knowing that goods with inelastic supply are less likely to face shortages after taxation, while subsidies on elastic goods can boost output significantly. During crises, understanding PES helps governments ensure the availability of essential goods by focusing on non-price mechanisms for inelastic supplies. In long-term planning, PES aids in prioritizing infrastructure and policies that support industries needing supply adaptability.

## Chapter 13: Market economic system

1) **What is meant by an economic system?**
	- An economic system is the way in which an economy is organised and run including different views of how scarce resources are best allocated.
2) **What are the three main types of economic system?**
	- Planned economy
	- Mixed economy
	- Market economy
3) **What are the key features of the market economic system?**
	- A market economy relies on the market forces of demand and supply (in the private sector) to allocate resources with minimal government intervention.
4) **What are the advantages of operating a market economy?**
	- Advantages of the market economy include: efficiency in the use and allocation of resources, freedom of choice and incentives to work
5) **What are the disadvantages of operating a market economy?**
	- Disadvantages of the market economy include: income and wealth inequalities, environmental degradation, depletion of non-renewable resources, social hardship and wasteful competition.

## Chapter 14: Market Failure

1) **When and why does market failure occur?**
	- Market failure occurs when the market forces of demand and supply are unsuccessful in allocating resources efficiently.
2) **Give three examples of market failure.**
	- A lack of government intervention causes demerit goods like cigarettes to be overproduced and overconsumed.
	- The government is forced to provide street lighting and roads since firms are unwilling to provide them.
	- Hospitals increase prices on their services to increase their profit, causing negative spillover effects.
3) **What are the differences between private external and social costs?**
	- Private costs are the actual costs of a firm, individual, or government. External costs are negative side effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties for which no compensation is paid. Social cost is the sum of them both.
4) **What are the differences between private external and social benefits?**
	- Private benefits are benefits of production and consumption enjoyed by a firm, individual, or government. External benefits are the positive side effects of production or consumption experienced by third parties for which no money is paid by the beneficiary. Social benefit is the sum of them both.
5) **What are public goods?**
	- Public goods are goods that the private sector fails to provide due to a lack of profit motive.
6) **What are the differences between merit and demerit goods?**
	- Merit goods are goods that have social benefits but are under-provided and under-consumed without government intervention or provision. Meanwhile, goods that have social costs when consumed or produced but are over-produced and over-consumed without government intervention.
7) **What are the social benefits of public provision of education?**
	- Public provision of education leads to increased literacy, higher productivity, and improved economic growth. It creates positive externalities like reduced crime rates, improved public health, and more informed citizens who contribute to societal development.
8) **What is meant by the abuse of monopoly power?**
	- The abuse of monopoly power occurs when a monopolist exploits its market dominance to restrict output, raise prices, or limit competition, leading to reduced consumer welfare and allocative inefficiency in the market.
9) **How does factor immobility cause market failure?**
	- Factor immobility occurs when resources such as labour, capital, or land cannot move easily between industries or locations. This leads to underutilisation or misallocation of resources, causing inefficiencies and market failure.
10) **Distinguish between occupational and geographic mobility.**
	- Occupational mobility occurs when it is difficult to move a factor of production from one type of work or job role to another. Meanwhile, geographic mobility occurs when it is difficult to move a factor of production from one geographical location to another

## Chapter 15: Mixed economic system

1) **What is meant by a mixed economic system?**
	- A mixed economic system is a combination between planned and market economies. The degree of public and private sector involvement in economic activities is determined by the government.
2) **What are the advantages and disadvantages of operating a mixed economic system?**
	- The positives and negatives of a mixed economic system depend on whether is closer to a planned or market economy and by how much. This is controlled by the government. Mixed economies have a balance between private enterprise and government intervention allowing for efficiency and social welfare. A mixed economy may also have disadvantages like potential inefficiencies from overregulation and conflicts between public and private sector goals.
3) **What is meant by a maximum price, and why might governments impose this?**
	- A maximum price is a price ceiling set below the market equilibrium to make essential goods more affordable. Governments impose it to protect consumers from excessively high prices, especially for necessities like food and housing.
4) **What is meant by a minimum price, and why might governments impose this?**
	- A minimum price is a price floor set above the market equilibrium to ensure fair income for producers. Governments impose it to support industries with underpaid work or to discourage harmful consumption, such as alcohol.
5) **Why might a national minimum wage, set above the market equilibrium, cause unemployment?**
	- A minimum wage above the equilibrium increases labour costs, leading firms to hire fewer workers, potentially creating excess supply of labour and unemployment.
6) **How does indirect taxation work to correct certain market failures?**
	- Indirect taxation is the act of imposing taxes on specific products (usually demerit goods) to reduce demand.
7) **How might subsidies be used to correct certain market failures?**
	- A subsidy is government financial assistance to reduce prices and increase demand
8) **How might the use of rules and regulation help to correct certain market failures?**
	- Governments may use rules and regulations to decrease consumption or production of demerit goods or increase consumption or production of merit goods
9) **How might the use of education and advertising reduce the consumption of cigarettes?**
	- Governments may mandate that schools teach students about the negative side effects of demerit goods and positive side effects of merit goods. 
10) **What is the difference between privatisation and nationalisation with regard to the correction of market failure?**
	- Nationalisation is the purchase of private sector assets by the government, while privatisation is the transfer of the ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector. A government may choose to privatise a business for various reasons like: to reduce government debt (they won't have to maintain the business anymore), to earn the one-time privatisation proceeds from the sale, to allow the business to be more competitive in the market, etc.
