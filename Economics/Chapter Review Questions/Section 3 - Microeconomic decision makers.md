## Chapter 17 - Households

1) **What are the main factors that affect the level of consumer spending in an economy?**
	- Income
	- Interest rates
	- Confidence levels
	- Inflation
	- Age
	- Size of households
2) **How will the spending, borrowing and saving patterns of a young family with two children under the age of 5 compare with those of an old-aged pensioner?**
	- A family with multiple children will have a greater income than an old-aged pensioner. However, they would also have much high spending overall, and would not be able to save much. An old-aged pensioner would have a low income, low spending, and would likely borrow money.
3) **How do spending and saving patterns of low income earners differ from those of high income earners?**
	- Low income earners spend most of their income on necessities, while high income earners spend a smaller portion of their income on them and can spend on luxuries. Low income earners usually can't save much since they have less disposable income, unlike high income earners who are able to save more.
4) **How does wealth affect a person’s level of spending, saving and borrowing?**
	- Wealthier individuals tend to have higher levels of disposable income, which allows them to spend more on both necessities and luxuries. They can save a larger portion of their income due to financial stability and are less likely to borrow. In contrast, less wealthy individuals may have to borrow more to meet basic needs and have limited capacity for saving.
5) **How do changes in interest rates influence consumer spending, saving and borrowing?**
	- Higher interest rates discourage borrowing as the cost of loans increases, and they encourage saving due to better returns on savings accounts. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, leading to increased consumer spending, while the incentive to save diminishes.
6) **What are the main determinants of the level of savings in an economy?**
	- The level of savings depends on factors like income levels, interest rates, inflation, government policies, and consumer confidence. Higher disposable income and favourable interest rates encourage saving, while economic uncertainty or high inflation often leads to reduced saving.
7) **What factors affect the level of borrowing in an economy?**
	- Borrowing levels are influenced by interest rates, consumer confidence, income levels, inflation, and access to credit. Low interest rates and economic optimism encourage borrowing, while high interest rates, low incomes, and restrictive lending policies suppress it.
8) **Why might one person save more of their income than another?**
	- Differences in saving habits arise due to factors like income levels, financial goals, age, and risk tolerance. Higher earners or individuals with fewer financial obligations can save more. Additionally, those with a cautious financial outlook or long-term goals prioritize saving over spending.

## Chapter 18 - Workers

1) **How do wage and non-wage factors differ, regarding a worker’s choice of occupations?**
	- Wage factors are financial rewards received by workers in exchange for their labour services. Meanwhile, non-wage factors are rewards received by workers that are not monetary.
	- Generally, skilled workers get more overall earnings than unskilled workers due to their relatively high demand and low supply. There is a large supply of unskilled workers, so they usually earn less.
	- Usually primary sector workers earn the least, since most of their work is unskilled. Additionally, the wages paid to workers is usually dependant on the cost of the product produced. Primary sector workers normally produce products with low sales values. Similarly, tertiary sector workers usually provide services with greater cost values, so they earn more, in general.
	- Workers in the private sector usually earn more money than workers in the public sector, since firms in the private sector aim for profit maximisation. Also, men are generally paid more than women.
2) **What are fringe benefits?**
	- Fringe benefits (or perks) are additional benefits (with monetary value)
3) **How are wages determined?**
	- Wages are determined based on the following factors:
		- Demand for labour
		- Supply for labour
		- Equilibrium wage rate
		- Relative bargaining power
		- Minimum wage
4) **What is meant by the demand for labour, and what are the factors that affect the demand for labour?**
	- The demand for labour is the number of workers that firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate. The factors that affect demand for labour are: the level of total demand in the economy, the productivity of labour, the cost of labour.
5) **What is derived demand?**
	- Derived demand is demand for a factor of production that is not demanded for itself but for the goods and services it is used to produce.
6) **What is meant by the supply of labour, and what are the factors that affect the supply of labour?**
	- The supply of labour is everyone in an economy who is of working age and is both willing and able to work at a specific wage rate. The factors that affect supply of labour are: labour force participation rate, availability and level of welfare benefits, changing social attitudes, geographical mobility, occupational mobility.
7) **Why might the supply of labour curve be backward bending after a certain wage rate is reached?**
	- The supply of labour curve bends backwards when wage rates rise to a high enough point to allow people to work less and enjoy more leisure hours.
8) **How are wages determined in a market economy?**
	- Wages in a market economy are determined by the forces of demand and supply for labour. The equilibrium wage rate is established where the demand for labour (from firms) equals the supply of labour (from workers). Factors like worker productivity, skill levels, and bargaining power can shift these forces, affecting wage levels.
9) **How might a national minimum wage affect the demand for and supply of labour?**
	- A national minimum wage increases the lowest possible wage workers can receive. It leads to overall higher incomes for workers but can reduce the demand for labour as firms face higher costs. On the other hand, it can increase the supply of labour as more individuals are incentivized to work due to higher pay.
10) **What are the various factors that influence differences in earnings between workers?**
	- Workers may have differences in earnings due to varying skill levels, qualifications, experience, gender, and industry type. Additionally, workers in high-demand, low-supply occupations or in sectors generating higher revenues typically earn more.
11) **How do the division of labour and specialisation of labour improve productivity and efficiency?**
	- Division of labour and specialisation allow workers to focus on specific tasks, reducing training time and improving expertise. This leads to faster production, lower costs, and greater efficiency. It also enables firms to produce higher-quality goods and services at scale.

## Chapter 19 - Trade Unions

1) **What is meant by a trade union?**
	- A trade union (or labour union) is an organisation that aims to protect the interests of its worker members.
2) **Why might a worker join a trade union?**
	- Workers would want to join trade unions to help settle conflicts between employers and employees over wages, working conditions, non-wage benefits, etc.
3) **How do the aims and objectives of employees differ from those of employers?**
	- Employers generally want to maximise profits, minimise costs, and maximise sales. Meanwhile, employees generally want to maximise wages/salaries, work in a safe and healthy environment, have good terms and conditions at work, maximise their non-wage benefits, have job security at work.
4) **What are the main types of trade union?**
	- The four major types of trade unions are craft unions, industrial unions, white collar unions, and general unions.
5) **What are the main roles of trade unions?**
	- A trade union's primary role is to protect the interests of its members. Other than that, trade unions also bargain with employers, ensure their members safety at work, provide legal advice and support to workers, and persuade governments to pass legislation in favour of workers.
6) **What is meant by the collective bargaining process?**
	- Collective bargaining is the process of trade union representatives negotiating on behalf of their worker members with employer representatives for better pay and conditions.
7) **What is meant by industrial action and why might it occur?**

10) **What are the advantages and disadvantages of trade unions?**
	- **Advantages**: Trade unions protect workers’ rights, ensure fair wages, and improve working conditions. They provide a collective voice for employees, making it easier to negotiate with employers. Trade unions also offer legal support and advocate for policies that benefit workers.
	- **Disadvantages**: Trade unions can cause disruptions through industrial actions like strikes, impacting productivity and businesses. They may also demand higher wages, increasing costs for employers, which could lead to job losses. Additionally, union membership fees can be a financial burden for workers.
