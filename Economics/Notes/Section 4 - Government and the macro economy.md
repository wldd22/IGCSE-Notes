## Chapter 24 - The role of the government

- **The general role of the government** is to improve the general welfare of its people.
- The government collects tax revenues in order to fund its expenditure
- The government operates three roles:
	- **Local role** - Provides public and merit goods
		- Rubbish collection
		- Street lighting
		- Building libraries, schools, hospitals, and public parks
	- **National role** - Makes decisions about how to achieve the macroeconomic roles (See [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 25 - The macroeconomic aims of government||chapter 25]] for more details) using appropriate policies like:
		- **Fiscal Policy:**
		    - Government decisions on raising money through taxation and other sources.
		    - Allocation of the annual budget on welfare, education, healthcare, defence, etc.
		- **Monetary Policy:**
		    - Central bank or monetary authority decisions on interest rates and money supply.
		    - Aims to influence economic activity.
		- **Supply-Side Policies:**
		    - Adjustments to minimum wage levels.
		    - Creation of bodies like a Competition Commission to regulate firm behaviour.
		    - Focused on promoting economic growth by increasing productive capacity.
		- **Policies to Protect the Environment:**
		    - Includes international agreements like the Paris Agreement.
		    - Aim to address environmental issues and promote sustainability.
	- **International role**
		- Manages international trade
		- **Trading bloc** - Free trade area which also promotes the free movement of factors of production between member countries.

## Chapter 25 - The macroeconomic aims of government

- Governments have 5 main macroeconomic aims:
- **Economic Growth**
	- **Definition**
		- Annual increase in the level of national output
		- Annual percentage change in GDP (Gross domestic product)
		- Representation of a long-term expansion in the production capacity of the economy
		- Outward shift of the production possibility curve (see [[Subjects/Economics/Notes/Section 1 - The basic economic problem#Chapter 4 Production possibility curve|chapter 4]] for more details)
	- Most practical measure of standards of living
- **Full employment / Low unemployment**
	- **Unemployment** - When a person is:
		- Willing and able to work
		- Actively seeking employment
		- Unable to find work
	- High employment leads to economic growth
	- **Unemployment rate**: $\frac{N}{T}\times100$ where N is the number of unemployed people and T is the total number of people in the workforce (included employed and unemployed people)
- **Stable prices / Low inflation**
	- **Inflation** - Sustained rise in the general price level in an economy
	- Price of every good or service doesn't rise, rather, average prices rise
	- Usually, governments set a target rate in order to control economic activity
	- Not completely bad because higher prices can encourage firms to supply more output
- **Balance of payments stability**
	- **Balance of payments** - A financial record of a country's transactions with the rest of the world during a single year.
		- Includes country's trade in goods and services with other countries.
		- **Credit items** - Payment received from other countries
		- **Debit items** - Payment made to other countries
	- In theory, the balance of payments should balance over time because, a country, like an individual, can only spend what it earns.
	- **Balance of payments deficit** - Country is uncompetitive in international markets
	- **Balance of payments surplus** - Country is overcompetitive in international markets
- **Redistribution of income**
	- Achieving greater equality in the distribution of income in an economy
	- Economies face unequitable distribution of income due to the naturally unequal ownership of factors of production in a free market economy
	- **Taxation** is used to redistribute income
		- **Progressive taxation** - A type of taxation that charges higher percentage tax as an individual's income rises
	- Other ways to redistribute income are:
		- Subsidies
		- Welfare benefits
- **Conflicts between aims**
	- Usually impossible to achieve all five goals at once
	- Governments may be left with a trade off
	- The government has to decide which aim is the most important to the economy at a particular time
	- **Potentials conflicts:**
		- **Full employment versus stable prices**
			- When more people are earning more money, firms may raise their prices more causing **demand-pull inflation**.
			- When more people are employed, firms find it harder to attract skilled labour, leading to wage inflation (**Cost-push inflation**)
		- **Economic growth versus balance of payments stability**
			- If economic growth is cause by higher consumption expenditure, it may cause a deficit in the country's balance of payments
		- **Full employment versus balance of payments stability**
			- As employment rises, people get wealthier and spend more money on imports causing a deficit in the balance of payments
		- **Economic growth versus stable prices**
			- A cut interest rates or an increase in the money supply in order to stimulate economic growth can conflict with inflation causing price instability.

## Chapter 26 - Fiscal policy

- **Government Budget** - The government's financial plans in terms of planned revenues and expenditures
	- **Balanced budget** - When the government balances its revenues and its spending
	- **Budget deficit** - When revenues are lower than expenditures
	- **Budget surplus** - When revenues are greater than expenditures
- **Tax** - A government levy on income or expenditure
	- **Direct and indirect taxation**
		- **Direct tax** - Paid from the income, wealth, or profit of individuals and firms
		- **Indirect tax** - Expenditure tax imposed on spending on goods and services
	- **Types of taxation**
		- **Progressive**
			- As income rises, the rate of tax imposed rises (tax percentage rises)
		- **Regressive**
			- As income rises, the rate of tax imposed falls (tax percentage falls)
			- Includes taxes that are the same *amount* at any income level (the tax percentage decreases at higher income levels)
		- **Proportional**
			- Rate of tax remains constant at any income level
	- **Principles of taxation**
		- **Equitable (fair)** - Taxes should be based on the taxpayer's ability to pay
		- **Economical** - Tax should be easy and cheap to collect
		- **Convenience** - The method of payment should be convenient to the taxpayer
		- **Certainty** - The taxpayer should know what, when, where, and how to pay the tax
		- **Efficiency** - The tax system should attempt to achieve its aims without any undesirable side-effects
		- **Flexibility** - Taxes should be flexible enough to adapt to a change in the economic environment
	- **Classification of taxes:**

| Tax               | Definition                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Income tax        | A direct tax levied on personal incomes - wages, interest, rent, and dividends. In most countries, this is the main source of tax revenues                               |
| Corporation tax   | A direct tax on the profits of businesses                                                                                                                                |
| Sales tax         | An indirect tax, such as VAT, charged on an individual's spending                                                                                                        |
| Excise duties     | Indirect inland taxes imposed on certain goods and services such as alcohol, tobacco, petrol, soft drinks and gambling                                                   |
| Customs duties    | Indirect cross-border taxes on foreign imports                                                                                                                           |

| Windfall tax      | A tax charged on individuals and firms that gain an unexpected one-off<br>amount of money, such as a person winning the lottery or a firm gaining<br>from a takeover bid |

- **Fiscal Policy** - The use of taxation and government expenditure to influence the level of economic activity and achieve macroeconomic goals
	- Taxes can be used to redistribute income and wealth, benefiting less wealthy members of society.
	- Government spending improves living standards, like building infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads, etc.).
- **Fiscal Policy Measures**
	- **Expansionary Fiscal Policy:**
	    - Increases government spending and/or lowers taxes to stimulate the economy.
		- Used to reduce the effects of economic recessions by boosting consumption and investment, reducing unemployment.
	    - Example: Increase in social security payments or lowering of income taxes.
	- **Contractionary Fiscal Policy:**
		- Reduces the level of economic activity by decreasing government spending or raising taxes.
	    - Aims to reduce inflationary pressures during economic booms.
	    - Example: Property taxes used to slow down house prices during a housing bubble.
- **Effects of Fiscal Policy on Macroeconomic Aims:**
	- **Economic Growth:**
	    - Capital expenditure on infrastructure boosts investment.
	    - Lower corporate tax rates attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
	- **Stable Prices / Low Inflation:**
	    - Lower taxes and increased productivity keep price levels low.
	    - Contractionary measures prevent price levels from soaring.
	  - **Employment:**
		- Cuts in income tax incentivize people to seek jobs.
		- Government support for startups can lower unemployment.
	  - **Balance of Payments Stability:**
	    - Low tax rates help domestic firms remain competitive, aiding exports.
	    - Subsidizing industries also improves international competitiveness.
	  - **Redistribution of Income:**
		- Progressive taxes and government spending (welfare, education, healthcare) redistribute income effectively.

## Chapter 27 - Monetary policy

- **Definition of Monetary Policy**
	- The manipulation of interest rates, exchange rates, and the money supply to control the level of spending and investment in the economy.
	- Used to affect macroeconomic objectives such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
	- The central bank typically oversees these policies.
- **Monetary Policy Measures:**
	- **Changes in Interest Rates:**
		- The primary tool to control economic activity.
		- Higher rates discourage borrowing and encourage saving, reducing overall spending.
		- Lower rates encourage borrowing and spending, boosting economic activity.
	- **Changes in the Money Supply:**
	    - Increasing or decreasing the money supply affects consumption and investment.
	    - For example, allowing banks to lend more stimulates economic growth.
	- **Changes in Exchange Rates:**
	    - Exchange rates impact the domestic money supply as purchasing foreign goods requires converting currencies.
- **Types of Monetary Policy:**
	- **Expansionary (Loose) Monetary Policy:**
	    - Lowers interest rates to boost economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and increasing disposable income.
	    - Encourages households and firms to spend and invest more.
	- **Contractionary (Tight) Monetary Policy:**
	    - Increases interest rates to reduce inflation by curbing excessive spending.
	    - Can reduce economic growth and employment in the long term.
- **Effects of Monetary Policy on Macroeconomic Aims:**
	- **Economic Growth:**
	    - Lower interest rates decrease borrowing costs, encouraging consumption and investment.
	    - Less saving leads to higher demand and growth.
	- **Full Employment / Low Unemployment:**
	    - Economic growth from lower interest rates tends to create more jobs.
	- **Stable Prices / Low Inflation:**
	    - Higher interest rates control inflation by reducing demand, while lower rates boost economic output without driving up prices.
	- **Balance of Payments Stability:**
	    - A lower exchange rate improves international competitiveness, boosting exports.
- **Limitations of Monetary Policy:**
	- There can be time lags before interest rate changes take effect, making the outcome uncertain.
	- Consumer and business confidence also play a role in economic activity, so monetary policy alone might not be sufficient.
	- Higher interest rates can deter foreign investment and reduce production capacity.

## Chapter 28 - Supply-side policy

- **Supply-side policies** - Long-term measures to increase the productive capacity of the economy, leading to an outward shift of the production possibility curve.
	- Supply-side policies improve the quality and/or quantity of factors of production
	- **Examples:**
		- **Education and training** - Improving education and training results in a workforce with better skills, productivity, flexibility, and mobility.
		- **Labour market reforms** - Reducing or removing: the power of trade unions, unemployment benefits, minimum wages.
		- **Lower direct taxes** - Reducing tax on worker income to create more incentive
		- **Deregulation** - Reduction or removal of barriers of entry.
		- **Improving incentives to work** - Reducing taxes on worker income, reducing unemployment benefits, etc.
		- **Improving incentives to invest** - Using tax incentives and subsidies encourage firms to invest.
		- **Privatisation** - Selling government assets (like properties and businesses) to private individuals and firms to be run more efficiently.
- **Effects on macroeconomic aims**
	- **Economic growth** - Supply-side policies, like investment in education and corporate tax cuts, increase the economy's productive capacity, fostering long-term growth.
	- **Full employment/Low unemployment** - Increasing productive capacity creates jobs, while policies like training reduce frictional and structural unemployment.
	- **Stable prices/Low inflation** - Supply-side measures boost productivity, preventing excessive price rises and avoiding demand-pull inflation caused by demand-side policies.
	- **Balance of payments stability** - Higher productivity enhances international competitiveness, increasing export earnings and improving the balance of payments.
	- **Redistribution of income** - Policies such as education investment and lower basic income tax rates benefit low-income earners, increasing their disposable income and spending potential.

## Chapter 29 - Economic growth

- Definition of **economic growth**
	- Annual increase in the level of national output
	- Annual percentage change in GDP
- **GDP (Gross domestic product)** (Also called **nominal GDP**) - A measure of the monetary value of goods and services produced within a country for a given period of time, usually one year.
	- Formula:
		- $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$
		- $C=\text{Consumption expenditure}$
			- Total private household consumption in the country
		- $I=\text{Investment expenditure}$
		- $G=\text{Government spending}$
		- $X=\text{Export earnings}$
		- $M=\text{Import expenditure}$
	- **Real GDP** - Nominal GDP adjusted for inflation
	- **GDP per head (or GDP per capita)** - The GDP of a country divided by its population
- **Business cycle (or trade cycle)** - Describes the fluctuations in the economic activity of a country over time, creating a long-term trend of economic growth in the economy
	- Shown on a graph (GDP / time)
	- **Trend** - The trend line shows the overall change in GDP over time
	- **Peak** - GDP is at its highest level
		- Unemployment is low
		- Consumer and business confidence are high
	- **Recession** - GDP falls for two consecutive quarters (6 months)
		- Decline in consumption, investment, and net exports
		- **Causes:**
			- Higher level of unemployment
			- Higher interest rates (discourages investment, encourages saving)
			- Greater uncertainty in the economy
			- Lower rates of disposable income (fall in consumer spending)
			- Lower levels of government expenditure
			- Decline in the demand for exports
			- Lower levels of consumer and business confidence
	- **Slump (or trough)** - Lowest point of a recession
		- High unemployment
		- Low consumption, investment, and net export earnings
	- **Recovery** - GDP starts to rise after a slump
		- Rising consumption, investment, and net export earnings
		- Leads to employment opportunities in the long run
	- **Boom** - GDP rises for two consecutive quarters (6 months)
		- Level of economic activity rises
		- Caused by any combination of an increase in consumption, investment, government spending, and net export earnings.
- **Economic growth**
	- **Causes:**
		- Factor endowments (Quality and quantity of factors of production0
		- Labour force (Size, skills, and mobility of the workforce)
		- Labour productivity
		- Investment expenditure
	- **Positive consequences:**
		- Improved standards of living
		- Higher levels of employment
		- Tax revenues
	- **Negative consequences:**
		- Environmental consequences
		- Risk of inflation
		- Inequalities in income and wealth
		- Resource repletion
	- **Policies to increase economic growth:**
		- Fiscal policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 26 - Fiscal policy|chapter 26]])
		- Monetary policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 27 - Monetary policy|chapter 27]])
		- Supply-side policies (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 28 - Supply-side policy|chapter 28]])

## Chapter 30 - Employment and unemployment

- **Employment** - The use of factors of production in the economy (usually labour)
- **Full employment/Low unemployment as a macroeconomic aim** (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 25 - The macroeconomic aims of government|chapter 25]]):
	- Raises standards of living for the average person
	- Promotes economic growth
	- Increases tax revenues
	- Welfare benefits are decreased
	- Prevents **brain drain** (when highly skilled workers leave the country in search of job opportunities elsewhere)
	- Reduces income and wealth inequalities
- **Unemployment** - Occurs when people of working age are both willing and able to work but cannot find employment
- **Full employment** - Everyone in an economy who is willing and able to work has a job
- **Employment patterns** (as the economy develops):
	- **Employment sector** - Primary sector workforce decreases overall and tertiary sector workforce increases
	- **Delayed entry to the workforce** - More people spend more time studying for tertiary sector jobs and the average age of employees entering the workforce rises
	- **Ageing population** - The average age of the population increases (due to longer life expectancy and lower birth rates) so firms are forced to hire more older employees
	- **Formal sector employment** - More workers shift from informal employment to formal employment
		- **Formal employment** - Workers pay income tax and contribute to the economy's GDP
	- **Female participation rates** - More women are active in the labour force
	- **Public sector employment** - Decline in worker force in the public sector
	- **Flexible working patterns** - Firms offer more flexible working patterns (like working from home, part-time jobs, and flexible working hours)
- **Measuring unemployment**
	- Two methods:
		- **Claimant count** - Counts the number of people receiving unemployment benefits
			- People can only claim unemployment benefits if they can prove that they are actively looking for full-time employment
		- **Labour force survey (LFS)** - Uses the ILO’s standardised household-based survey to collect work-related statistics. (**ILO - International labour organisation**)
			- Unemployment measure is based on people who are:
				- Willing to work, but unable to find employment
				- Actively seeking work (i.e. they have looked for a job in the last 4 weeks)
				- Able to start work within the next 2 weeks
				- Going to start a new job within the next 2 weeks
	- **Unemployment rate** - Measure of the percentage of a country’s workforce that is out of employment.
		- **Formula**
			- $\dfrac{\text{Number of unemployed people}}{\text{Total workforce}}\times100$
- **Types of unemployment:**
	- **Frictional unemployment** - Transitional unemployment which occurs when people change jobs or are in-between jobs
	- **Structural unemployment** - The demand for products produced in a particular industry continually falls, causing firms to downscale and fire employees
		- Usually due to foreign competition
	- **Cyclic unemployment** (or demand-deficient unemployment) - Unemployment caused by a lack of demand
		- Causes a fall in national income
		- Most severe type of unemployment as it can affect every industry in the economy
- **Consequences of unemployment:**
	- Unemployed individuals may suffer from mental-health disorders, other health problems, and in extreme cases homelessness and possibly suicide
	- The family and friends of unemployed individuals may have to pay for their expenses leading to lower disposable income and possible disagreements
	- Mass unemployment could lead to poverty, falling house prices (hence asset values), and increased crime rates
	- Lower levels of consumer spending, investment, and firm profits, possibly leading to business failures and bankruptcy
	- The government has to pay more overall for welfare benefits
	- A higher proportion of taxpayer money is used for welfare benefits and so the government faces an opportunity cost
	- The economy is less internationally competitive
- **Policies to reduce unemployment:**
	- Fiscal policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 26 - Fiscal policy|chapter 26]])
	- Monetary policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 27 - Monetary policy|chapter 27]])
	- Protectionist measures (see [[Section 6 - International trade and globalisation#Chapter 38 - Foreign exchange rates|chapter 38]])
	- Supply-side policies (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 28 - Supply-side policy|chapter 28]])
		- Examples:
			- Investment in education and training
			- Reduction in trade union powers
			- Incentives for firms to train and hire more employees
			- Reducing welfare benefits

## Chapter 31 - Inflation and deflation

- **Inflation** - The sustained rise in the general level of prices of goods and services over time
	- Average price level rises
	- Reduces the value of money
	- Reduces the spending power of individuals
	- **Hyperinflation** - Very high rates of inflation that are out of control, causing average prices in the economy to rise very rapidly
- **Deflation** - The sustained fall in the general price level in an economy over time (negative inflation rate)
	- **Benign deflation** (or non-threatening deflation) - Deflation caused by higher supply of goods and services
		- Increases the productive capacity of the economy
		- Drives down the general price level of goods and services
		- Increasing national income
	- **Malign deflation** (or harmful deflation) - Deflation caused by demand for goods and services falling
		- Often due to economic recession and/or rising levels of unemployment
- **Consumer price index (CPI)** - Weighted index of consumer prices in the economy over time
	- Used to measure the cost of living for an average household and find the inflation rate
	- Measures price changes of a representative basket of goods and services (consumed by an average household)
	- Applies statistical weights to each item to include the relative importance of the average household's expenditure
		- Based on the proportion of an average household’s spending on the items in the representative basket of goods and services
	- Changes in the CPI represent changes in the cost of living for the average household in the economy
	- Used for international comparison of inflation rates
	- **Calculating CPI step-by-step:**
		- **Define the base year** - Assign the base year a CPI value of 100. This serves as the benchmark for price comparisons.
		- **Select a representative basket** - Identify goods and services that reflect typical household spending patterns.
		- **Collect price data** - Gather monthly prices for the items in the basket.
		- **Calculate the price index** - Divide the current basket price by the base year basket price, then multiply by 100 to obtain the CPI.
		- **Apply statistical weights** - Assign weights to each item in the basket to reflect its importance in household spending. Multiply each item's price index by its weight.
		- **Calculate the weighted CPI** - Sum the weighted indices of all items to obtain the overall CPI.
		- **Determine the inflation rate** - Calculate the percentage change in the CPI over a given time period to measure inflation.
- **Causes of inflation and deflation:**
	- **Cost-push inflation** - Inflation caused by higher costs of production, thus increasing the general price level
	- **Demand-pull inflation** - Inflation caused by higher levels of demand in the economy, thus increasing the general price level
	- **Imported inflation** - Inflation caused by higher import prices, increasing costs of production and thus causing domestic inflation.
	- **Increases in the money supply or easier access to credit** (such as loans and credit cards)
- **Consequences of inflation:**
	- **Menu costs** - Catalogues, price lists, and menus need to updated to reflect price changes
	- **Consumers** - The purchasing power of consumers goes down due to the lower value of money
	- **Shoe leather costs** - Customers waste time and energy looking for better deals to save money
	- **Savers** - Interest received when saving money, if unchanged, decreases due to inflation
	- **Lenders** - Money lent out to borrowers decreases in value when returns
	- **Borrowers** - Value of the money returned is less than the value of the money borrowed
	- **Fixed income earners** - Fixed income decreased in value due to inflation (i.e. the real income falls)
	- **Low income earners** - Are affected severely by inflation due to them having a high price elasticity of demand
	- **Exporters** - The international competitiveness of an economy tends to fall due to domestic inflation
	- **Importers** - Imports are more expensive due to the lower purchasing power of money
	- **Employees** - Workers are likely to demand higher wages due to the decreasing value of money
		- **Wage-price spiral** - Trade unions negotiate higher wages to keep income in line with inflation, inadvertently causing more inflation
	- **Employers** - The value of money is uncertain and return on investment is lower (due to higher costs of production)
- **Consequences of deflation:**
	- **Unemployment** - Deflation reduces demand for goods and services, leading to job losses
	- **Bankruptcies** - Deflation lowers sales and profits, causing many firms to go bankrupt
	- **Wealth Effect** - Falling profits during deflation decrease share prices and shareholder wealth
	- **Debt Effect** - Deflation raises the real cost of debts, reducing confidence in consumers and businesses
	- **Government Debt** - Economic decline during deflation reduces tax revenue and increases government borrowing needs
	- **Consumer Confidence** - Deflation lowers consumer confidence, delaying purchases and worsening the economy
- **Policies to control inflation and deflation:**
	- Fiscal policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 26 - Fiscal policy|chapter 26]])
	- Monetary policy (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 27 - Monetary policy|chapter 27]])
	- Supply-side policies (see [[Section 4 - Government and the macro economy#Chapter 28 - Supply-side policy|chapter 28]])
