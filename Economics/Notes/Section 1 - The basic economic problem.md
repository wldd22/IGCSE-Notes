## Chapter 1: The nature of the economic problem

- **Basic economic problem** - How to allocate scarce resources to satisfy people's unlimited needs and wants as efficiently as possible.
	- There are unlimited wants and limited resources
- **Economic agents** - The decision makers of an economy
	- Three types:
		- Individuals or households
		- Firms and businesses
		- The government
- **Basic economic questions** - Questions addressed by the economic agents
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- **Economic sectors**
	- **Private sector** - The economic activity of private individuals and firms
		- The main aim is to earn profit for its owners.
	- **Public sector** - The economic activity directly involving the government
		- The main aim is to provide a service.
- **Goods and services**
	- **Goods** - Physical items that can be produced, bought, and sold
		- Examples: Furniture, clothing, stationary
	- **Services** - Intangible items that be provided and paid for
		- Examples: Haircuts, education, concerts
- **Needs and wants**
	- **Needs** - Goods and services that are essential for survival
		- Examples: Nutritional food, clean water, shelter, protection, clothing and access to healthcare and education
	- **Wants** - Goods and services that are not necessary for survival
		- Demanded by economic agents to fulfil their human desires
- **Economic goods and free goods**
	- **Economic goods** - Goods that are limited in supply
		- Examples: Oil, wheat, cotton
	- **Free goods** - Goods that are unlimited in supply
		- Examples: Air, seawater, sunlight

## Chapter 2: The factors of production

- **Factors of production** - The resources required to produce a good or service
	- **Land** - Natural resources required in the production process
		- Examples: Coal, wood, oil
		- Reward: Rent
	- **Labour** - Human effort required in the production process
		- Includes skilled and unskilled labour
		- Reward: Wages and salaries
	- **Capital** - Manufactured resources used in the production process
		- Examples: Machinery, tools, vehicles
		- Reward: Interest
	- **Enterprise** - Skills required to combine and manage the other factors successfully
		- Reward: Profit
- **Income** - The collective rewards of the factors of production
- Quantity and quality of factors of production change when there is a change in the demand for and/or supply of land, labour, capital or enterprise.
- **Factor mobility** - The extent to which factors of production (usually labour) can be changed for one another in the production process.
	- **Geographic mobility** - The extent to which labour is willing and able to move to different locations for employment purposes.
		- May be due to family ties or costs of living
	- **Occupational mobility** - The extent to which labour is able to move between jobs. Retraining and upskilling help workers to improve occupational mobility.

## Chapter 3: Opportunity cost

- **Opportunity cost** - The cost of the next best opportunity forgone when making a decision.
	- Opportunity costs occur because economic agents have to make competing choices due to finite resources. (i.e. opportunity costs occur due to scarcity)
	- Economic agents have to choose where to allocate their resources and money.

## Chapter 4: Production possibility curve

- **Production possibility curve (PPC)** - Graph that shows the maximum combination of goods or services of two types in an economy, at a point of time
	- Shows the productive capacity of an economy
	- Points under the curve are possible to achieve with the current available resources in the economy and more can be produced without any opportunity cost (since some factors of production are currently unused)
	- Points on the curve represent the maximum production possible with the available resources
	- Points above the curve show combinations of products that aren't possible to produce with the current available resources in the economy
- **Movements along the PPC**
	- When an economy is on the PPC, that means all its resources are being used (there is no unemployment of factors of production) and that there is efficiency in the use of resources (factors of production are allocated to their best use/purpose)
	- A movement on the PPC causes an opportunity cost. (i.e. To produce more of one product, less of another product is produced)
- **Shifts of the PPC**
	- **Outward shift** - The PPC shifts outwards indicating a greater productive capacity
		- The productive capacity of the economy increases without necessarily incurring an opportunity cost.
		- Caused by:
			- An increase in the quality of factors of production or
			- An increase in the quantity of factors of production
	- **Inward shift** - The PPC shifts inwards indicating a lesser productive capacity
