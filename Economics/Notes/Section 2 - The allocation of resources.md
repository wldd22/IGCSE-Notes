## Chapter 5: Microeconomics and macroeconomics

- **Microeconomics** - The study of particular markets and sections of the economy, rather than the economy as a whole.
	- Tends to use theory rather than empirical evidence
	- Decision makers: Individuals, households, firms
- **Macroeconomics** - The study of economic behaviour and decision making in the whole economy rather than individual markets.
	- Places greater emphasis on using empirical data as evidence to explain changes in the economy (such as booms and recessions)
	- Decision makers: Governments

## Chapter 6: The role of markets in allocating resources

- **Market system / Price mechanism** - Refers to the method of allocating scarce resources through the market forces of demand and supply.
	- **Market equilibrium** - Occurs when the demand for a product matches the supply so there is no excess demand (shortage) or excess supply (surplus)
	- **Market disequilibrium** - Occurs when the price for a product is too high or too low / when supply doesn't equal demand
	- Features:
		- No government interference in economic activity
		- Allocation of resources based on price and financial incentives
		- Competition creating choice and opportunities for firms and private individuals
- **Key economic questions**
	- What to produce
	- How to produce
	- For whom to produce

## Chapter 7: Demand

- **Demand** - The willingness and the ability of customers to pay a given price to buy a good or service
- **Quantity demanded** - The amount of a good or service demanded at a given price level\
- **Law of Demand** - There is an inverse relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded
	- When the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity demanded increases
	- When the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases
- **Determinants of demand**
	- **Habits, fashions, tastes** - When a product becomes popular or in fashion, the demand for it increases.
	- **Income** - When customer incomes are higher, they are able and willing to buy more goods and services.
	- **Substitutes and complements**
		- **Substitutes** are goods or services that can used instead of each other (ex. Coca-Cola and Pepsi). When the price for one decrease, it is likely the demand for its substitute also decreases
		- **Compliments** are products that are jointly demanded (ex. tennis racquets and tennis balls). When the price of one increases, the demands for both are likely to decrease.
	- **Advertising** - When a firm advertises their products more, it is likely that there will be more demand for them
	- **Government policies** - Government rules and regulations on specific goods or services (like taxes on alcohol and tobacco) will affect the demand for those products.
	- **Economy** - The state of the economy has a large impact on the demand for products in a market.
	- **Weather / Climate**
	- **Demographics of the population** - like age, gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs
- **Demand Curve** - The demand curve is shown as a downward sloping curve to indicate the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.
	- **Movements along the curve** - Only caused by changes in price
		- When the price rises, it causes a **contraction** in demand (the quantity demanded decreases)
		- When the price falls, it causes a **extension** in demand (the quantity demanded increases)
- **Market demand** - The aggregation of all individual demand for a product
	- Found by adding up all individual demand at each price level.
- **Shifts in demand** - Caused by non-price factors that affect demand
	- **Increase in demand** - Rightward shift in the demand curve.
	- **Decrease in demand** - Leftward shift in the demand curve.

## Chapter 8: Supply

- **Supply** - The ability and willingness of firms to provide goods and services at given price levels
- **Law of Supply** - There is a positive relationship between price and the quantity supplied of a product.
	- When price increases, firms tend to supply more
	- When price decreases, firms tend to supply less
	- Reasons:
		- Existing firms can earn higher profits if they supply more.
		- New firms are able to join them market if the higher price allows them to cover their production costs.
- **Determinants of supply**
	- **Time**
	- **Weather**
	- **Opportunity Cost**
	- **Taxes**
	- **Innovations**
	- **Production costs**
	- **Subsidies** - A type of financial assistance from the government to incentive providing specific goods or services by reducing the costs of production for firms.
- **Movements along the supply curve**
	- When the price rises, it causes a **extension** in demand curve
	- When the price falls, it causes a **contraction** in supply curve
- **Market supply** - The aggregation of all individual supply for a product
	- Found by adding up all individual supply at each price level.

## Chapter 9: Price determination

- **Market equilibrium**
	- **Equilibrium price** - price at which the demand curve for a product intersects the supply curve for the product. (or the price at market equilibrium)
- **Market disequilibrium**
	- Quantity demanded for a product is either higher or lower than the quantity supplied.
	- There are either shortages or surpluses.
	- **Shortages**
		- When the selling price of a product is set below the equilibrium price
		- Demand exceeds supply
		- Excess demand creates a shortage
		- To fix it, price needs to be increased (to decrease demand and increase supply)
	- **Surpluses**
		- When the selling price of a product is set above the equilibrium price
		- Supply exceeds demand
		- Excess supply creates a surplus
		- To fix it, price needs to be decreased (to increase demand and decrease supply)

## Chapter 10: Price changes

- Equilibrium price can be changed by non-price factors that affect the supply and demand curves.
- Examples:
	- **Supply curve moving left** - A sales tax imposed on tobacco products increasing their price.
	- **Supply curve moving right** - Favourable weather conditions increasing level of agricultural output.
	- **Demand curve moving left** - Negative publicity causing demand for a specific product to decrease.
	- **Demand curve moving right** - Higher household incomes leading to an increase in the demand for new cars.

## Chapter 11: Price elasticity of demand

- **Price elasticity of demand (PED / $E_D$)** - the degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a product following a change in its price.
	- Formula: $E_D = \frac{\%ΔQ_D}{\%ΔP} = \text{percentage change in quantity demanded} \div \text{percentage change in price}$
	- PED will be negative because of the law of demand
- **Interpretation of PED**
	- PED < 1 - **Price inelastic** - Quantity demanded is less responsive to price changes.
	- PED > 1 - **Price elastic** - Quantity demanded is more responsive to price changes.
	- PED = 0 - **Perfectly price inelastic** - A change in price has no impact on the quantity demanded.
	- PED = ∞ - **Perfectly price elastic** - A change in price leads to zero quantity demanded.
	- PED = 1 - **Unitary price elasticity** - Percentage change in the quantity demanded is proportional to the change in price
- **Determinants of PED**
	- **Substitution:** The availability of close substitutes makes demand more elastic, as consumers can easily switch to alternative products if the price of the original product rises.
	- **Income:** As income levels change, the demand for goods can become more or less elastic. Higher income may make demand less elastic for basic goods, while lower income might increase elasticity as consumers become more price-sensitive.
	- **Necessity:** Necessities tend to have inelastic demand because consumers need to purchase them regardless of price changes, whereas luxury goods often have more elastic demand.
	- **Habits, Addictions, Fashions, and Tastes:** Strong consumer preferences or addictions can make demand inelastic, as people continue to buy despite price increases. Conversely, fashion trends can make demand more elastic as they change rapidly.
	- **Advertising and Brand Loyalty:** Effective advertising and strong brand loyalty can make demand more inelastic, as consumers are less likely to switch to competing products even if prices rise.
	- **Time:** Over time, demand can become more elastic as consumers find alternatives or change their consumption habits. In the short term, demand is often less elastic.
	- **Durability:** Durable goods, which are long-lasting, tend to have more elastic demand because consumers can postpone purchases during price increases.
	- **The Costs of Switching:** If switching costs are high, demand is likely to be inelastic, as consumers are reluctant to change to a new product due to additional expenses or effort.
	- **The Breadth of Definition of the Product:** Products defined broadly tend to have more inelastic demand because substitutes are less readily available, while narrowly defined products face more elastic demand due to more specific substitutes.
- **Sales revenue (or total revenue)** - The sum of money received from the sale of a good or service.
	- Sales revenue = price × quantity demanded
- **Profit** = Total revenue - Total Costs

| Price Change   | Inelastic demand | Unitary demand        | Elastic demand |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Increase price | Revenues rise    | No change in revenues | Revenues fall  |
| Reduce price   | Revenues fall    | No change in revenues | Revenues rise  |
^ Relationship between PED and sales revenues ^

- **Significance of price elasticity of demand for decision makers**
	- Helping producers to decide on their pricing strategy
	- Predicting the impact on producers to impose sales taxes on
	- Determining taxation policies

## Chapter 12: Price elasticity of supply

- **Price elasticity of supply (PES / $E_S$)** - the degree of responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a product following a change in its price.
	- Formula: $E_S = \frac{\%ΔQ_S}{\%ΔP} = \text{percentage change in quantity supplied} \div \text{percentage change in price}$
	- PES will be positive because of the law of supply
- **Interpretation of PES**
	- $\text{PES}<1$ - **Price inelastic** - Quantity supplied is less responsive to price changes.
	- $\text{PES}>1$ - **Price elastic** - Quantity supplied is more responsive to price changes.
	- $\text{PES}=0$ - **Perfectly price inelastic** - A change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied.
	- $\text{PES}=\infty$ - **Perfectly price elastic** - Quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.
	- $\text{PES}=1$ - **Unitary price elasticity** - Percentage change in the quantity supplied is proportional to the change in price.
- **Determinants of PES**
	- **The Degree of Spare Productive Capacity:** When firms have spare capacity, they can increase production quickly in response to price increases, making supply more elastic.
	- **The Level of Stocks:** High levels of stock or inventory allow producers to respond more flexibly to changes in price, increasing supply elasticity.
	- **The Number of Producers in the Industry:** A greater number of producers can make supply more elastic, as increased competition encourages producers to respond to price changes more readily.
	- **The Time Period:** Supply is usually more elastic over the long term because producers have more time to adjust production processes, acquire resources, or enter/exit the market.
	- **The Ease and Cost of Factor Substitution:** The easier and less costly it is to switch production factors (like labour and machinery) between different uses, the more elastic the supply will be, as producers can adapt quickly to changes in market conditions.

- **Significance of price elasticity of supply for decision makers**
	- Creating spare capacity
	- Keeping large volumes of stocks (inventories)
	- Improving storage systems to prolong the shelf-life of products
	- Adopting or upgrading to the latest technology
	- Improving distribution systems (how the products get to the customers)
	- Developing and training employees to improve labour occupational mobility (to perform a range of jobs)

## Chapter 13: Market economic system

- **Economic system** - The way in which an economy is organised and run including alternative views of how scarce resources are best allocated.
- **Economic agents** - Households and firms
- Main types of economic systems:
	- **Planned economy**
		- Relies on the government (in the public sector) allocating resources.
		- Examples: North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba
	- **Mixed economy**
		- Combination of market and planned economy
		- Some resources owned and controlled by private individuals and firms, others owned and controlled by the government.
			- Examples: Japan, Italy, Spain
	- **Market economy**
		- Relies on the market forces of demand and supply (in the private sector) to allocate resources with minimal government intervention.
		- Examples: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand
		- **Advantages**
			- Efficiency
			- Freedom of choice
			- Incentives
		- **Disadvantages**
			- Income and wealth inequalities
			- Environmental issues
			- Social hardship
			- Wasteful competition

## Chapter 14: Market Failure

- **Market Failure** - Occurs when the market forces of demand and supply are unsuccessful in allocating resources efficiently.
	- Causes **external costs** or **external benefits**
- **Private costs** - Actual costs of a firm, individual, or government
- **External costs** - Negative side effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties for which no compensation is paid
	- Examples:
		- Air pollution caused by fumes from a factory
		- Noise pollution from a nightclub
		- Cigarette smoke
- **Social costs** - Total costs of consumption or production to society as a whole
	- Social costs = Private costs + External costs
- **Private benefits** - Benefits of production and consumption enjoyed by a firm, individual, or government
- **External benefits** - Positive side effects of production or consumption experienced by third parties for which no money is paid by the beneficiary.
- **Social benefits** - Total benefits of consumption or production to society as a whole
	- Social benefits = Private benefits + External benefits
- Causes and consequences of market failure:
	- **Public goods** - Goods that the private sector fails to provide due to a lack of profit motive.
		- Examples:
			- Street lighting
			- Road signs
			- Law and order
			- National defence
			- Lighthouses
			- Public roads
		- Non-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption. (It isn't possible to exclude non-payers from the product and there is no competition to purchase or use the product)
	- **Merit goods** - Goods that have social benefits but are under-provided and under-consumed without government intervention or provision.
		- Examples:
			- Education
			- Healthcare services
			- Vaccinations
		- They create positive spill over effects for third parties
	- **Demerit goods** - Goods that have social costs when consumed or produced but are over-produced and over-consumed without government intervention
		- Examples:
			- Cigarettes
			- Alcohol
			- Recreational drugs
			- Gambling
	- **Abuse of monopoly power** - Profit-maximising monopolists lack incentives to be competitive, so create inefficiencies in the market (For more detail see [[Subjects/Economics/Notes/Section 3 - Microeconomic decision makers#Chapter 23 - Market structure|chapter 23]])
	- **Factor Immobility** - When it is difficult for factors of production to be moved between different uses or locations.
		- **Geographical immobility**
		- **Occupational immobility**

## Chapter 15: Mixed economic system

- **Mixed economic system** - Combination between planned and market economies.
	- The degree of public and private sector involvement in economic activities is determined by the government.
- **Maximum prices** - Method of price control where the government sets the maximum price of a product below the market equilibrium price
	- Makes products more affordable and encourages consumption.
	- Creates excess demand
- **Minimum prices** - Government sets the minimum price of a product above the market equilibrium price
	- Creates incentive to supply more
	- Creates excess supply
- **Methods to correct market failures:**
	- **Indirect taxation** - Imposing taxes on specific products (usually demerit goods) to reduce demand
	- **Subsidies** - Government financial assistance to reduce prices and increase demand
	- **Rules and regulations**
	- **Education** - Mandate that schools teach students about the negative side effects of demerit goods
	- **Privatisation** - The transfer of the ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector
	- **Nationalisation** - Purchase of private sector assets by the government
	-  **Direct provision** - Providing certain goods and services free of charge to citizens
