- **Electrolysis** - Decomposition of an ionic compound, when in molten or aqueous state, by passing an electric current through it
	- **Electrolyte** - The molten or aqueous substance that undergoes electrolysis
		- **Molten** - Heated till it becomes a liquid
		- **Aqueous** - Dissolved in water
	- **Electrode** - A rod made of a conductive material (usually metal or graphite) that allows electric current to pass through the electrolyte
		- **Cathode** - Negative electrode (attracts cations)
			- **Cation** - Positively charged ion (after losing electrons)
			- Electrons move through power supply to cathode
			- Cations in the electrolyte are attracted to the cathode and undergo reduction
			- **Reduction** - Gain of electrons
		- **Anode** - Positive electrode (attracts anions)
			- **Anion** - Negatively charged ion (after gaining electrons)
			- Electrons move from anode to power supply
			- Anions in the electrolyte are attracted to the anode and undergo oxidation
			- **Oxidation** - Loss of electrons
	- **Power supply**
		- The power supply provides the voltage to move an electric current through the circuit
		- When current flows in the external circuit, electrons carry the charge
		- When current flows in the electrolyte, ions carry the charge
	- **Products**
		- When ions touch the electrodes, electrons are lost or gained, creating neutral substances: the products
		- Two ionic half equations are used to represent the reactions at each electrode. Example:
			- **Cathode:** $Na^++e^-\longrightarrow Na$
			- **Anode:** $2Cl^--2e^-\longrightarrow Cl_2$
				- Rearranged to follow convention:
				- $2Cl^-\longrightarrow Cl_2+2e^-$

- **Inert electrodes** - Electrodes that don't take part in the electrolysis process
	- Usually platinum or graphite
- **Example of electrolysis with a molten electrolyte:**
	- **Electrolyte** - $\text{Molten Lead (II) Bromide}$ ($PbBr_2$)
	- **Electrodes** - Platinum electrodes
	- **Reactions:**
		- **Cathode:** $Pb^{2+}+2e^-\longrightarrow Pb$ (precipitate)
		- **Anode:** $2Br^-\longrightarrow Br_2+2e^-$ (bubbles)
- **Electrolysis with an aqueous electrolyte**
	- The electrolyte contains ions from the compound and from water (hydrogen and hydroxide)
	- **Cathode**
		- Either the **metal** or **hydrogen** is discharged
		- Less reactive ion is discharged
		- **Reactivity series (from most to least reactive):**
			- $K$ - **Potassium**
			- $Na$ - **Sodium**
			- $Li$ - **Lithium**
			- $Ca$ - **Calcium**
			- $Mg$ - **Magnesium**
			- $Al$ - **Aluminium**
			- $C$ - **Carbon**
			- $Zn$ - **Zinc**
			- $Fe$ - **Iron**
			- $H$ - **Hydrogen**
			- $Cu$ - **Copper**
			- $Ag$ - **Silver**
			- $Au$ - **Gold**
		- Hydrogen is discharged unless the metal is copper, silver, or gold
		- Other ion remains in the solution
	- **Anode**
		- Either the **non-metal** or **hydroxide** is discharged
		- **If the electrolyte is concentrated:**
			- If non-metal is a halide, it is discharged
				- **Halides** - $F$, $Cl$, $Br$, $I$, $At$, $Ts$
			- Otherwise, hydroxide is discharged
		- **Otherwise, in a diluted solution**
			- Hydroxide is discharged
		- Other ion remains in the solution
		- **Discharged halide** forms a **halogen**
		- **Discharged hydroxide** forms **oxygen gas and water**
			- $4OH^-\longrightarrow O_2+2H_2O+4e^-$
	- Remaining ions react in the electrolyte
	- **Example:**
		- **Electrolyte** - $\text{Concentrated Aqueous Sodium Chloride}$ ($NaCl$)
		- **Electrodes** - Graphite electrodes
		- **Reactions:**
			- **Cathode:**
				- Sodium is more reactive than hydrogen, so hydrogen is discharged
				- Hydrogen gas is formed (bubbles)
				- $2H^++2e^-\longrightarrow H_2$
			- **Anode:**
				- The electrolyte is concentrated and chloride is a halide, so chloride is discharged
				- Chlorine gas is formed (bubbles)
				- $2Cl^-\longrightarrow Cl_2+2e^-$
		- **Remaining electrolyte** - $NaOH$
	- **Example:**
		- **Electrolyte** - $\text{Dilute Aqueous Sulphuric Acid}$ ($H_2SO_4$)
		- **Electrodes** - Platinum electrodes
		- **Reactions:**
			- **Cathode:**
				- Both cations are hydrogen, so hydrogen is discharged
				- Hydrogen gas is formed (bubbles)
				- $2H^++2e^-\longrightarrow H_2$
			- **Anode:**
				- The electrolyte is dilute, so hydroxide is discharged
				- Oxygen gas and water is formed (bubbles)
				- $4OH^-\longrightarrow O_2+2H_2O+4e^-$
		- **Remaining electrolyte** - $H_2SO_4$

## Part 3/3 (https://youtu.be/pqpeSbLPDgQ)

- **Example of electrolysis with inert electrodes:**
	- **Electrolyte** - $\text{Aqueous Copper (II) Sulphate}$ ($CuSO_4$)
	- **Electrodes** - Graphite electrodes
	- **Reactions:**
		- **Cathode:**
			- Copper is less reactive than hydrogen, so copper is discharged
			- Solid copper is formed (precipitate)
			- $Cu^{2+}+2e^-\longrightarrow Cu$
		- **Anode:**
			- Sulphate is not a halide, so hydroxide is discharged
			- Oxygen gas and water is formed (bubbles)
			- $4OH^-\longrightarrow O_2+2H_2O+4e^-$
	- **Remaining electrolyte** - $H_2SO_4$
- **Electroplating** - Method used to cover a metal object with a thin layer of metal, using electrolysis (Coating one metal with another)
	- Commonly used to improve the appearance of an object or its resistance to corrosion
	- **Method:**
		- **Cathode** - Object that needs to be electroplated
		- **Anode** - Made of the metal used to coat the object (plating metal)
		- **Electrolyte** - Contains ions of the plating metal
	- **Process:**
		- Metal ions in the electrolyte deposit on the cathode
		- Metal ions are replaced in the electrolyte by the anode
	- **Example:**
		- **Electrolyte** - $\text{Silver Nitrate}$ ($AgNO_3$)
		- **Electrodes** - $\text{Iron}$ ($Fe$) cathode and $Silver$ ($Ag$) anode
		- **Reactions:**
			- **Cathode:**
				- Silver is less reactive than hydrogen, so it gets discharged
				- Silver gets coated (precipitate)
				- $Ag^++e^-\longrightarrow Ag$
			- **Anode:**
				- Atoms in the anode lose electrons to form ions
