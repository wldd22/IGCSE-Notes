- **Metals:**
	- Form positive ions by losing electrons (due to less valence electrons)
	- Elements with more shells are more reactive
	- **Physical properties**
		- **Metallic bonding** (strong)
		- Malleable (ability to make into sheets)
		- Ductile (ability to make into wires)
		- Lustrous (Shiny)
		- Sonorous (Create ringing sound)
		- Heat and electricity conductors
		- High melting and boiling points
	- **Structure**
		- Giant grid of atoms arranged in regular pattern (lattice)
		- Outer shell electrons are shared between all atoms in the metal
		- Contains a sea of delocalised electrons (they can carry electricity and heat)
- **Transition metals:**
	- Have all properties of metals
	- Can form more than one ion
	- Ions are often coloured
	- Very good **catalysts** (substances which increase the rate of a chemical reaction without participating in it)
- **Non-metals:**
	- Form negative ions or don't form ions
	- **Physical properties**
		- Dull
		- Brittle (easily break)
		- Low melting and boiling points
		- Poor conductors of electricity
		- Lower density
- **Bonding**
	- **Ionic bonding** - Metals with non-metals
	- **Covalent bonding** - Non-metals with non-metals
	- **Metallic bonding** - Metals with metals
- **Alloys**
	- Mixture of two or more metals (can also be made by mixing a metal and non-metal)
	- Two elements usually have different sized atoms
		- Disrupts the arrangement
		- Prevents layers sliding over each other
		- Makes the alloy harder (than pure metal)
- **Reactivity**
	- **Measured by:**
		- Violence of reaction
		- Speed of reaction
		- Temperature change during reaction (metal samples must have same mass and surface area for comparison)
		- **Displacement reactions**
	- **Reactivity series** (Descending order \*Non-metals included for convenience)
		- $K$ - Potassium
		- $Na$ - Sodium
		- $Ca$ - Calcium
		- $Mg$ - Magnesium
		- $Al$ - Aluminium
		- $C$ - Carbon*
		- $Zn$ - Zinc
		- $Fe$ - Iron
		- $H$ - Hydrogen*
		- $Cu$ - Copper (Usually doesn't react at all)
		- $Ag$ - Silver (Usually doesn't react at all)
		- $Au$ - Gold (Almost never reacts)
	- $\text{Metal}+\text{Acid}\longrightarrow\text{Salt}+\text{Water}$
	- $\text{Metal}+\text{Water}\longrightarrow\text{Metal Hydroxide}+\text{Hydrogen}$ (Only occurs with the most reactive metals)
	- **Displacement reactions**
		- More reactive metals can displace less reactive metals
		- **Examples:**
			- $Mg+FeSO_4\longrightarrow MgSO_4+Fe$
			- $Cu+FeSO_4\longrightarrow Cu+FeSO_4$ (No reaction)
		- Can be used to extract less reactive metals from their compounds (like metal oxide) using more reactive metals
