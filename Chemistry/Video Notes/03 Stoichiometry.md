## Relative Formula Mass

- **Mass number** - Number of protons + Number of neutrons
- **Relative atomic mass** ($A_r$) - Average mass of all the isotopes of the element
- **Relative formula mass** ($M_r$) - Sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in a compound's molecular formula

## Conservation of Mass

- **Law of Conservation of Mass** - No atoms are created or destroyed (only bonds change)
	- Applies with actual masses (5g of reactants must react to form 5g of products)
	- Gases reacting or being produced can't be weighed easily and may be difficult to measure
	- A sealed container to used to measure the mass accurately

## How to Find the Volume of a Gas

- $\text{Volume of gas} = \text{Moles} \times 24$
	- $\text{Volume of gas}$ is in $dm^3$
	- Only applies at room temperature and pressure ($r.t.p.$)
- $\text{Moles}=\dfrac{\text{Mass}}{M_r}$
	- $\text{Mass}$ is in $g$

## Moles, Concentration & Volume Calculations

- $\text{Moles}=\text{Concentration}\times\text{Volume}$
	- $\text{Concentration}$ is in $\dfrac{mol}{dm^3}$ or $moldm^{-3}$
	- $\text{Volume}$ is in $dm^3$
- $cm^3$ to $dm^3$ - $\div1000$
- $dm^3$ to $cm^3$ - $\times1000$

## How to Calculate Concentration in grams per decimetre cubed

- $1dm^3=1\text{ litre (of water)}$
- Concentration can also be in $\dfrac{g}{dm^3}$ or $gdm^{-3}$

## Atom Economy

- **Atom economy** - The percent of the reactants in a reaction that form a useful/wanted product
	- $\text{Atom economy}=\dfrac{M_r\text{ of desired products}}{M_r\text{ of all reactants}}\times100$
	- If there are no waste products, the atom economy is 100%

## State Symbols

- **Solid** - $s$
- **Liquid** - $l$
- **Gas** - $g$
- **Aqueous** - $aq$
	- Substance dissolved in water

## Percentage Yield

- **Percentage Yield** - Amount of product
	- Measured in grams or mols
	- **Actual yield** - Amount of product gotten from the reaction
	- **Theoretical yield** - Yield expected based on calculations
	- **Reasons actual yield is lower than theoretical yield**
		- Reactants may not all react
		- Reactants react to produce a different product than expected (side reaction)
		- Some of the product may be lost during the process
	- $\text{Percentage yield}=\dfrac{\text{Actual yield}}{\text{Theoretical yield}}\times100$
