- **Fossil fuels** - Fuel made from organisms living millions of years ago
- **Biofuel** - Fuel made from recently living organisms
	- Generally from plants or algae
	- Burning them releases carbon dioxide
		- However, they are considered carbon neutral because the carbon released is equal to the carbon absorbed while the living organisms were growing
		- No overall release of carbon dioxide
	- **Advantages**
		- Renewable
		- Cheap to make
		- Easy to transport
		- Can be mixed with fossil fuels
	- **Disadvantages**
		- A location is needed to grow the plants
		- Harvesting, processing, and transport of the plants and fuel require energy
