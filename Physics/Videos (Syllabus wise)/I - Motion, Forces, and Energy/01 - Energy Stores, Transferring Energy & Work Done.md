	- An object's energy is stored in one of its energy stores
	- Energy can be transferred from one object to another
		- **Mechanically**
		- **Electrically**
		- **By heating**
		- **By radiation** (like light or sound waves)
- **System** - A collection of matter
	- Energy is transferred between different objects and forms
	- **Outside world** - All the matter outside the system
	- **Open system**
		- Matter may exchange energy or matter with the outside world
		- May lose or gain energy or matter to and from the outside world
	- **Closed system**
		- Separate from the outside world
		- Neither matter nor energy can enter or leave
		- Energy may be transferred within the system
		- Overall energy remains constant
- **Work done** (Energy transferred)
	- **Mechanical** - Using a force to move an object
	- **Electrical** - When current flows
