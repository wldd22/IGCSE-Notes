- **Wind Power**
	- Captured using **wind turbines**
		- Placed in exposed areas with strong winds
		- Each turbine has a generator inside
		- As the blades spin in the wind, the generator turns
		- The generator converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy
- **Solar Power**
	- Generated by **solar cells** usually in the form of **solar panels**
		- Generate electric current directly from sunlight
		- Work well in low energy devices (like watches and calculators) and remote regions
- **Advantages and disadvantages**
	- **Pros**
		- Low running cost
		- No pollutants produced
		- Don't damage the environment
		- Decreasing in cost over time
	- **Cons**
		- High upfront costs
		- Making them does produce pollutants
		- Dependent on the weather
		- No way to increase supply quickly
		- Require lots of space
