- **Kinetic Energy** - The energy an object possesses due to its motion
	- Depends on the object's speed and mass
	- More kinetic energy is needed to move an object with a higher mass at the same speed
		- As mass increases and speed is constant, kinetic energy required increases
	- **Equation**
		- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}MV^2$
		- $\text{kinetic energy}(kgm/s) = \text{mass}(kg)\times \text{velocity}(m/s)$
