- **Gravity** - The force of attraction between two objects where the size of the force depends on the mass of the two objects and the distance between them
- **Gravitational Field** - The field around an object where another object experiences a gravitational force
	- **Weight** - The gravitational force experienced by an object when it is in a gravitational field
		- **Formula**
			- $w = mg$
			- $\text{weight}(N) = \text{mass}(kg)\times\text{gravitational field strength}(N/kg)$
	- **Gravitational Field Strength** - The strength of a gravitational field (Represented by $g$)
		- Earth's $g = 9.8\ N/kg$ ($9.8\ m/s^2$)
		- Moon's $g = 1.6\ N/kg$
- **Gravitational Potential Energy ($g.p.e.$)** - The energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field
	- **Formula**
		- $E_p = mgh$
		- $g.p.e.(J) = \text{mass}(kg)\times\text{gravitational field strength}(N/kg)\times\text{height}(m)$
