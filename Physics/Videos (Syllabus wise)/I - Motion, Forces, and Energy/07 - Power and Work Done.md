- **Power**
	- Rate at which **energy is transferred**
		- **Formula**
			- $P = \dfrac{E}{t}$
			- $\text{power (J/s)} = \dfrac{\text{energy transferred (J)}}{\text{time (s)}}$
	- Rate at which **work is done**
		- **Formula**
			- $P = \dfrac{W}{t}$
			- $\text{power (J/s)} = \dfrac{\text{work done (J)}}{\text{time (s)}}$
