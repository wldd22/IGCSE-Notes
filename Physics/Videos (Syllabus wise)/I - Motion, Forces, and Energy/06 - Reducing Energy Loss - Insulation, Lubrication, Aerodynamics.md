- **Reducing unwanted energy transfers** (for the example of a house)
	- Reducing heat loss by **convection**
		- The building is sealed closed
	- Reducing heat loss by **conduction**
		- Thick walls with low thermal conductivity
		- **Cavity walls** - Two layers of bricks with an air gap (cavity) between
			- Air has low thermal conductivity however, air allows for convection
			- To stop convection, the gap is filled with **insulating foam** (has lots of isolated air bubbles)
		- **Double glazing** - Window with two layers of glass with an air gap
			- Reduces conduction
	- Reducing heat loss by **friction**
		- **Lubrication** - Adding a slippery lubricant to a moving part to reduce friction
		- **Aerodynamics** - Making a moving object streamlined (smoother) to reduce friction against the air at higher speeds
