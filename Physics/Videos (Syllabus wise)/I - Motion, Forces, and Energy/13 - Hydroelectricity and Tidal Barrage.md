- **Hydroelectric dams and Tidal barrages**
	- A large dam with a higher water level on one side
	- **Reservoir** -  The water collected in a dam
	- The water in the reservoir has a large amount of g.p.e. (which can be converted into electricity)
		- The force of the water being released from the reservoir turns turbine blades in the dam and they generate electricity using generators
		- After being released, the water flows back into the river on the other side
	- **Advantages**
		- Large amounts of energy produced
		- No pollution
		- Running costs are low
		- Work on large and small scales
		- Reliable sources of electricity
		- (Hydroelectric dams) can provide an immediate response to an increased demand of energy
	- **Disadvantages**
		- Big impact on the surrounding impact
		- May stop boats and fish from traveling across the river
		- Initial setup is expensive
		- (Hydroelectric dams) often flood huge areas
	- **Hydroelectric dam**
		- Water from upstream is trapped on one side of the dam
	- **Tidal barrages**
		- Tides are used to trap water on one side of the dam
