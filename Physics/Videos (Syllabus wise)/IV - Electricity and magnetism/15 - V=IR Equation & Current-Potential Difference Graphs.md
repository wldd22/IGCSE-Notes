- **Ohm's law**
	- $V = IR$
	- $\text{potential difference (V)} = \text{current (A)}\times\text{resistance }(\ohm)$
- Graph plotted of current / potential difference
	- As **p.d. increases**, **current increases**
	- **Negative** shows the graph if the **power source is backwards**
	- $resistance = 1/m$ where m is the **gradient of the graph**
	- **Straight line** if resistance is **constant** at all voltages
		- Assuming the temperature is constant (resistance increases with **temperature**)
	- Filament lamp
		- Heats up as more voltage is provided, creating light
		- **Resistance increases** as **voltage increases**
	- Diode
		- High resistance in one direction, low resistance in the other
		- Only allows current to pass in the direction with lower resistance
