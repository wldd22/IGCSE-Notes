- **Series Circuit**
	- Contains a single loop
	- Components are connected sequentially
	- If one component is broken or disconnected, the whole circuit breaks
	- Potential difference is split between all components
		- $V_\text{t} = V_1 + V_2 + \cdots$
	- Current is the same everywhere
		- $I = \dfrac{V_t}{R_t}$
	- $R_{t} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots$
	- Voltmeters are connected in parallel
