- **Parallel Circuits**
	- Contains more than one loop
	- If a single component breaks or is removed, the circuit continues working
	- Generally, each loop contains one component
	- Assuming there is only one component per loop:
		- All components receive the same p.d.
			- $V_t = V_1 = V_2 = \cdots$
		- Current is shared between all components
			- $I_t = I_1 + I_2 + \cdots$
	- Resistance decreases as more components are added in parallel
