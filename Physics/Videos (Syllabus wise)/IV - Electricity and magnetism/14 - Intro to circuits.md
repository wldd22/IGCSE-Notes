- **Electrical circuit** - Closed loop containing a power source (ex. cell) and a path for electrons to flow through (ex. wire)
	- Represented using circuit diagrams
	- **Electrons** flow from the **negative terminal** of the power source to the **positive terminal**.
	- **Conventional current** flows from the **positive terminal** of the power source to the **negative terminal**.
- **Cell** - Component that acts as a power source in the circuit
- **Battery** - Component made up of two or more cells
- **Filament lamp** - Component that emits light when powered
- **Switch** - Component that can be opened or closed to let electrons through
- **Current** ($I$) - Measure of the flow of electrons around a circuit
	- Measured in amperes/amps ($A$)
- **Potential difference / Voltage** ($V$) - Force driving the flow of electrons
	- Provided by the power source
	- Measured in volts ($V$)
- **Resistance** ($R$) - The force which opposes the flow of electrons
	- Measured in ohms ($\ohm$)
