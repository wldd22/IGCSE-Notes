	- b) Give one use for a thermistor
		- In a water heater to check whether the water has been heated to the correct temperature
	- c) Explain why a thermistor is suitable for the use you chose in **b**
		- A thermistor changes resistance based on the temperature. It can be used in a circuit to detect whether the temperature is hot enough and turn on a lamp to indicate it.
- 4.
	- <span style="opacity:0.5">a) Redraw the circuit shown in Figure 19.8 so that a heater only comes on in the daytime. Include a light-dependent resistor in place of the thermistor and a heater in place of the lamp.</span>
	- b) Explain why the heater would be cold when the LDR is in darkness
		- When the LDR is in darkness, its resistance would become high. This would cause the relay coil to become unmagnetised and the switch in the other circuit to open again. When the switch opens the heater no longer has current flowing through it and would become cold.
	- c) Explain why the heater would be hot when light shines on the LDR
		- When light shines on the LDR, its resistance becomes low causing current to flow through it. This causes the relay coil to become magnetised and pull the switch in the second circuit closed. Current would then be able to flow through the second circuit, powering the heater and causing it to become hot.
- 5. A diode will allow an electric current to flow in one direction only. Using a lamp, battery and diode, draw a circuit diagram in which:

## 19.2 - Combinations of resistors

- 7. What are the advantages of connecting lamps in parallel in a lighting circuit?
	- Each one receives the full voltage of the mains supply
	- Each one can be provided with its own switch, so they can be operated separately
	- If one fails, the others remain lit
- 8. Three resistors are connected in series with a battery. Resistor A has the greatest resistance of the three. The current through A is $1.4\ A$. What can you say about the currents through B and C?
	- They are equal to $1.4\ A$ since it is a series circuit
- 9. What is the combined resistance of three $30\ \ohm$ resistors connected in series?
	- $30\ohm+30\ohm+30\ohm=90\ohm\ (R_t=R_1+R_2)$
- 10. One $4\ \ohm$ resistor and one $6\ \ohm$ resistor are connected in a series circuit with a $6\ V$ power supply. Calculate:
	- a) The combined resistance of the two resistors
		- $4\ohm+6\ohm=10\ohm\ (R_t=R_1+R_2)$
	- b) The current that flows in the circuit
		- $\dfrac{6V}{10\ohm}=0.6A\ (I=\dfrac{V}{R})$
	- c) The p.d. across each resistor
		- $0.6A*4\ohm=2.4V\ (V=IR)$
		- $0.6A*6\ohm=3.6V\ (V=IR)$
		- To verify: $2.4V+3.6V=6V$
- 11.
	- a) Two resistors are going to be connected to form a potential divider circuit. Should they be connected in series or in parallel with each other?
		- In series
	- b) State briefly the function of a potential divider circuit
		- To obtain a smaller p.d. than supplied or to obtain a variable p.d.
- 12.
	- a) Work out $V_1$ and $V_{in}$ in this figure
		- \[\[Potential divider circuit where $V_{in}=?,R_1=215\ohm,R_2=860\ohm,V_1=?,V_2=7.2V$]
		- $\dfrac{215\ohm}{860\ohm}=\dfrac{V_1}{7.2V}\ (\dfrac{R_1}{R_2}=\dfrac{V_1}{V_2})$
		- $0.25\times7.2V=V_1=1.8V$
		- $1.8V+7.2V=V_{in}=9.0V\ (V_{in}=V_1+V_2)$
	- b) Work out $V_1$ and $R_1$ in this figure
		- \[\[Potential divider circuit where $V_{in}=36V,R_1=?,R_2=80\ohm,V_1=?,V_2=8.0V$]
		- $36V-8.0V=V_1=28V\ (V_1=V_{in}-V_2)$
		- $\dfrac{R_1}{80\ohm}=\dfrac{28V}{8.0V}\ (\dfrac{R_1}{R_2}=\dfrac{V_1}{V_2})$
		- $80\ohm\times3.5=R_1=280\ohm$
- 13. Use the idea of resistors in series to explain why a long wire has more resistance than a short wire (of the same thickness and material)
	- Wires have resistance. The wire's total resistance is based on the length of the wire. A longer wire is like having more resistors together is series, so a longer wire has a higher resistance.
- 14. Use the idea of resistors in parallel to explain why a thick wire has less resistance than a thin wire (of the same length and material)
	- When resistors are in parallel, current has more paths to go through and so, the effective resistance is lower. Similarly, when there is a thick wire, the current has more areas in the wire to travel through, so the resistance is lower.
- 15. A $15.0\ \ohm$ resistor is connected in series with a $30.0\ \ohm$ resistor and a $15.0\ V$ power supply
	- a) Calculate the current flowing around the circuit
		- $\dfrac{15.0V}{15.0\ohm+30.0\ohm}=0.33A\ (I=\dfrac{V}{R})$
	- b) Which resistor will have the larger share of the p.d. across it?
		- The $30.0\ \ohm$ resistor
- 16. One $6\ \ohm$ resistor and one $4\ \ohm$ resistor are connected in parallel with a $6\ V$ power supply. Calculate:
	- a) The effective resistance of the two resistors
		- $\dfrac{1}{6\ohm}+\dfrac{1}{4\ohm}=\dfrac{1}{R_t}\ (\dfrac{1}{R_t}=\dfrac{1}{R_1}+\dfrac{1}{R_2})$
		- $R_t = 2.4\ohm$
	- b) The current flowing through each resistor
		- $\dfrac{6V}{6\ohm}=I_1=1A\ (I=\dfrac{V}{R})$
		- $\dfrac{6V}{4\ohm}=I_2=1.5A\ (I=\dfrac{V}{R})$
	- c) The current flowing from the power supply
		- $1A+1.5A=2.5A\ (I=I_1+I_2)$

## 19.3 - Electrical safety

- 18. Name the two main types of multi-plug adapters
	- Multi-way bar extension, Block adapter
- 19. What is often missing from a block adapter that makes it more dangerous to use than a multi-plug adapter?
	- A fuse
- 20. Why is it important not to overload a wall socket or any multi-plug adapter plugged into it
	- It may overheat causing a fire
- 21. In normal use, a current of $3.5\ A$ flows through a hair dryer. Choose a suitable fuse from the following: $3\ A$, $5\ A$, $13\ A$, $30\ A$. Explain your choice.
	- $5\ A$
	- A fuse of $3\ A$ would melt every time that the hairdryer was switched on. Fuses rated higher than $5\ A$ would allow too big a current to flow before melting and breaking the circuit.
- 22.
	- a) Why are fuses fitted in the fuse box of a domestic electricity supply?
		- To prevent too high of a current going through the circuits which would melt the wires and possibly cause a fire.
	- b) What device could be used in place of fuses?
		- Trip switches
- 23. What hazards can arise when the current flowing in an electrical wire is too high?
	- When the current gets too high, the insulation can giving off poisonous fumes, melt or catch fire.
- 24. Explain how an earth wire makes an electrical device safe
	- The earth wire provides a low resistance electrical path to ground and reduces the chances of a fatal electric shock.
- 25. Why must a switch be connected to the live wire and not the earth wire or neutral wire?
	- If it was connected to the neutral or earth wire, a current could still pass into the appliance even with the switch open. If the appliance was faulty and the live wire touched the metal casing, then a person touching the casing would get an electric shock.
- 26. Why should a fuse be connected to the live wire and not the earth wire or neutral wire?
	- If it was connected to the earth or neutral wire, a person could still get electrocuted when they touch the appliance.
- 27. Explain how a fuse works
	- A fuse melts and breaks the circuit when the current passing through is too high.
- 28. What is double insulation?
	- Double insulation is where the electric circuit for an electrical appliance is inside a plastic case, which is inside the outer case.
