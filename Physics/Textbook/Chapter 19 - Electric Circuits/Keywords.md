## 19.1 - Circuit components

- **Resistor** - A component in an electric circuit whose resistance decreases the current flowing
- **Variable resistor** - A resistor whose resistance can be changed, for example by turning a knob or moving a slider
- **Light-dependent resistor (LDR)** - A device whose resistance decreases when light shines on it
- **NTC Thermistor** - A resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing temperature
- **Relay** - A switch controlled by an electromagnet
- **Diode** - An electrical component that allows electric current to flow in one direction only
- **Light-emitting diode (LED)** - A type of diode that emits light when a current flows through it

## 19.2 - Combinations of resistors

- **Potential divider** - Part of a circuit consisting of two resistors connected in series to obtain a smaller voltage than supplied

## 19.3 - Electrical safety

- **Fuse** - A device that breaks the circuit if the current exceeds a certain value; it is a piece of metal wire that melts when too much current flows through it
- **Trip switch** - Safety device that includes a switch that opens (trips) when a current exceeds a certain value
- **Earthed** - When the case of an electrical
- **Double insulated** - When the electric circuit for an electrical appliance is placed inside a case made from an electrical insulator so that it is impossible for a live wire to touch the outer casing
