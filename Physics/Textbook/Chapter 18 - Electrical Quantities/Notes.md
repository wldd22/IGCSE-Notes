## 18.1 - Current in electric circuits

- **Electric Circuits**
	- Used to transfer energy from a battery or power supply to in components
- **Current** - The rate at which electric charge passes through a point in a circuit
	- For current to flow, two things are needed:
		- A complete circuit
			- Wires usually made of metals (such as copper or steel)
				- Because metals are good **conductors** of electric current
					- They contain electrons that can move about freely. These are called **conduction electrons**
			- Wires usually surrounded by plastic
				- Plastic is an **insulator** because it can't conduct electric current easily (Electrons are tightly bound within the atoms or molecules, so they can't move)
				- So that electric current cannot escape the wire and pass into unwanted areas
		- A device that provides the electromotive force required
			- **Electromotive force (e.m.f.)**
			- Examples are:
				- **Cell**
					- Device that provides e.m.f. in a circuit by means of a chemical reaction
					- The longer line is the positive terminal and the shorter line is the negative terminal
				- **Battery**
					- Two or more cells connected in series
				- **Power supply**
			- Conventional current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal
			- Electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal
	- **Direct Current (DC)** - Current that flows in the same direction all the time
	- **Alternating Current (AC)** - Current that periodically changes direction
	- **Definition**: Flow of electric charge
	- Measuring current
		- **Ammeter**
			- Types:
				- Analogue meter
					- Has a needle moving across a scale
					- Judgement of the position of the needle is needed
				- Digital meter
					- Gives direct read-out in figures
					- No judgement is needed
			- Connected in series so that the current can flow through it
			- If the ammeter is reversed, readings will be negative
			- Reading is in Amperes / Amps ($A$)
		- **Galvanometer** - Used to measure tiny currents
		- **SI Unit** - Amperes / Amps ($A$)
			- Milliamps: $1\ mA = 0.001\ A = 10^{-3}\ A$
			- Microamps: $1\ \mu A = 0.000\ 001\ A = 10^{-6}\ A$
- **Charge**
	- Is carried around a current by the current
	- Negative charge is carried by electrons

## 18.2 - Voltage in electric circuits

- **Voltage** - The energy transferred or work done per unit charge; can be imagined as the push of a battery or power supply in a circuit
- **Potential Difference** (almost the same as voltage, sometimes used interchangeably)
	- The work done by a unit charge passing through (or across) an electrical component
	- The voltage between two points
	- The difference in potential energy of a unit charge when it is moved between two points
- **Measuring voltage** (or p.d.)
	- **Voltmeter**
		- Used to measure potential difference across two points
		- May be analogue or digital
		- Connected in parallel to measure the potential difference between the two ends of a component
	- **SI Unit** - Volts ($V$)
- **Electromotive Force** (e.m.f.) - The potential difference/voltage across a cell
	- Also measured in volts ($V$)
	- **Combining e.m.f.s**
		- Most appliances need more than one cell
		- When cells are connected in series the combined e.m.f. is the sum of the e.m.f.s of the individual cells
		- When a cell is inverted, its e.m.f. is considered negative when combining with uninverted cells

## 18.3 - Electrical resistance

- **Resistance** - A measure of how difficult it is for an electric current to flow through a device or a component in a circuit
	- Measured in **ohms** ($\ohm$)
	- Defined as the potential difference across a component divided by the current passing through it ($1\ohm = 1\dfrac{V}{A}$)
	- $R\propto\dfrac{1}{I},\ V\ is\ constant$
		- Assuming $V$ is constant:
			- When $I$ increases, $R$ decreases
			- When $I$ decreases, $R$ increases
	- $V\propto I,\ R\ is\ constant$
		- Assuming $R$ is constant:
			- When $I$ increases, $V$ increases
			- When $I$ decreases, $V$ decreases
	- The **length of the wire** is proportional to resistance
		- When the wire is longer, resistance is higher
		- When the wire is short, resistance is lower
	- The **diameter of the wire** is inversely proportional to resistance
		- When the wire is thicker, resistance is lower
		- When the wire is thinner, resistance is higher
		- More specifically the **cross-sectional area of the wire** is inversely proportional to resistance

## 18.4 - More about electrical resistance

- The equation $R=\dfrac{V}{I}$ can be rearranged to form:
	- $I=\dfrac{V}{R}$
	- $V=IR$
- **Current-voltage characteristic ($I$-$V$ characteristic)** - A graph plotting the current against p.d. for a specific component.
	- $V$ is on the x-axis, it is the independent variable
	- $I$ is on the y-axis, it is the dependant variable
	- The line passes through the origin because if there is no voltage there can't be any current
	- For an **ohmic resistor**, the line is straight because resistance is constant
	- For a **filament lamp**, the line is not straight
		- It curves at higher voltages
		- When the voltage and current are small, it behaves like an ohmic resistor
		- As voltage increases the current increases less, showing that resistance increases
		- When the voltage increases, the high current causes the lamp to get hot and glow brightly. These high temperatures cause resistance to increase and so the current does increase as rapidly as before
	- The reciprocal of the gradient of this line at a given point is the resistance at that point. ( $R=\dfrac{V}{I}$) Therefore:
		- A steeper gradient at a point means the resistance is relatively lower
		- A more gradual gradient at a point means the resistance is relatively higher
	- The negative voltage on the graph shows current flowing in the opposite direction
	- For resistors and filament lamps, the graphs are **symmetrical** because the current will be the same for a given voltage no matter which direction they are connected
	- For a **diode**, the graph isn't symmetrical because the diode acts as a switch and only allows current to flow in one direction
- **Ohmic resistor** - A resistor with constant resistance
	- The $I$-$V$ characteristic is a straight line (the current through it is directly proportional to the voltage across it)
- **Diode** - Electrical component that only allows current to flow in one direction
	- The arrow on the symbol indicates the direction that conventional current can flow
	- Is a semiconductor
	- Behaves like an insulator until it is given enough voltage to make it behave like a conductor

## 18.5 Electrical energy, work and power

- Work done is the same as energy transferred
- **Power rating** - Indicates the maximum **electrical power** the appliance draws from the mains supply when it is operating at full power.
	- Shown on a label on most appliances
- **Electrical power** - The rate at which energy is transferred
	- $P=\dfrac{E}{t}$ ($E$ represents energy transferred)
	- **SI Unit** - Watts ($W$)
		- $1\ W =1\dfrac{J}{s}$
	- Depends on both the e.m.f. ($E$), of the supply and the current ($I$), that pushes it around the circuit.
	- $P=IV$
	- Since $E=Pt$ and $P=IV$:
		- $E=IVt$
	- For very large values of energy, it is inconvenient to use joules. Instead, kilowatt-hours ($kWh$) are used
		- $1kWh = 1000W\times3600s = 3.6\times10^6J$
		- $\text{energy transferred(kWh)}=\text{power(kW)}\times \text{time(hours)}$
