## 18.1 - Current in electric circuits

- **Current** - The rate at which electric charge passes a point in a circuit
- **Cell** - A device that provides an electromotive force (e.m.f.) in a circuit by means of a chemical reaction
- **Battery** - Two or more electrical cells connected together in series
- **Direct Current (d.c.)** - Electric current that flows in the same direction all the time
- **Alternating Current (a.c.)** - Electric current that periodically changes direction
- **Conductor** - A material that allows an electric current to flow through it
- **Insulator** - A material that makes it very difficult for an electric current to flow through it
- **Charge** - Carried around a circuit by the current; negative charge is carried by electrons
- **Galvanometer** - A meter for measuring tiny electric current
- **Ammeter** - A meter for measuring electric current
- **Ampere, amps (A)** - The SI unit of electric current

## 18.2 - Voltage in electric circuits

- **Voltage** - The energy transferred or work done per unit charge; it can be imagined as the push of a battery or power supply in a circuit
- **Potential difference (p.d.)** - The work done by (a unit) charge passing through an electrical component; another name for the voltage between two points
- **Volts (V)** - The SI unit of voltage (p.d. or e.m.f.); 1V = 1 J/C
- **Voltmeter** - A meter for measuring the p.d. (voltage) between two points
- **Electromotive force (e.m.f.)** - The electrical work done by a source (cell, battery, etc.) in moving (a unit) charge around a circuit; the voltage across the terminals of a source

## 18.3 - Electrical resistance

- **Resistance** - A measure of how difficult it is for an electric current to flow through a device or a component in a circuit; it is the p.d. across a component divided by the current through it
- **Ohm ($\ohm$)** - The SI unit of electrical resistance; 1$\ohm$ = 1 V/A

## 18.4 - More about electrical resistance

- **Current-voltage characteristic ($I$-$V$ characteristic)** - A graph of current on the vertical axis and voltage on the horizonal axis
- **Ohmic resistor** - Has a constant resistance; its $I$-$V$ characteristic is a straight line, so that the current through it is directly proportional to the voltage across it.

## 18.5 Electrical energy, work and power

- **Electrical power** - $\text{power} = \text{current}\times \text{p.d.} (P=VI)$
