- **Ernest Rutherford experiment**
	- **Method**
		- Alpha particles are fired at a thin piece of gold foil
		- They pass through the foil or deflect off and make a mark on a circular fluorescent screen
	- **Results**
		- Most of the particles remain undeflected and make marks behind the foil
		- Some particles are deflected and make marks around the screen
	- **Conclusion**
		- The positively charged alpha particles deflected away from the foil, meaning they were repelled by positively charged particles in the gold foil
		- Since so few particles were deflected, this must mean that the positive charge is concentrated in a small space inside the atom, called the nucleus
- **Atomic structure**
	- **Nucleus** - Concentrated space in the middle of the atom
		- Contains nucleons (**protons** and **neutrons**)
		- **Proton**
			- Mass: $1\text{ amu}$
			- Charge: $+1$
		- **Neutron**
			- Mass: $1\text{ amu}$
			- Charge: $0$
	- **Shells** - Rings of electrons orbiting the nucleus
		- Contain **electrons**
		- **Electron**
			- Mass: $1/1840\text{ amu}\approx0\text{ amu}$
			- Charge: $-1$
	- **Nucleon number (or mass number)** - Number of nucleons in a nucleus
	- **Proton number (or atomic number)** - Number of protons in a nucleus
	- **Format:** $\text{Symbol}_\text{Proton number}^\text{Nucleon number}$
- **Isotopes** - Same atomic number but different nucleon number
	- Same number of protons but different number of neutrons
	- Same properties but more neutrons means heavier
	- Example: $U_{92}^{235}$ and $U_{92}^{238}$
- **Nuclear fusion and fission**
	- **Nuclear fission** - When a nucleus is hit with an extra neutron causing it to become unstable and split into two nuclei with three extra neutrons
		- Example: $U_{92}^{235}+n_0^1\rightarrow Ba_{36}^{92}+Kr_{56}^{141}+3n_0^1+\text{energy}$
	- **Nuclear fusion** - When two nuclei join together to form a larger nucleus at a high temperature
		- Example: $H_1^2+H_1^2\rightarrow He_2^3+n_0^1+\text{energy}$
	- **Formula:** $E=mc^2$
		- $E$ - Energy released
		- $m$ - Mass lost
		- $c$ - Speed of light
