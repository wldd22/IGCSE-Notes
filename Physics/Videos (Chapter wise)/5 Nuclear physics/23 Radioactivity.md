- **Radioactive substance** - Substance that decays by emitting radiation
- **Hazards of radiation**
	- **Contamination** - When a radioactive substance is ingested, the person is contaminated and it can be very dangerous or fatal
	- **Irradiation** - When radiation or a radioactive substance hits a person, it gives them a dose of radiation and they become irradiated
- **Sources of radiation**
	- **Natural sources:**
		- **Atmosphere** - The air contains radon ($\text{Rn}$), a radioactive gas which seeps up from radioactive uranium rocks underground
		- **Ground** - The ground contains radioactive substances in some amounts
		- **Space** - Radiation is brought from space in the form of cosmic rays
	- **Human sources:**
		- **X-rays** - Used for medical imaging
		- **Gamma rays** - Used to kill cancerous cells
- **Geiger counter** - Used to detect radiation
	- Records the rate at which radiation is detected (count rate)
	- Measured in $\text{count}/s$ or $\text{count}/min$
- **Types of radiation:**
	- **Alpha particle ($\alpha$)**
		- **Made of:** 2 protons and 2 neutrons
		- **Charge:** $+2$
		- **Mass:** $4\text{ amu}$
		- **Speed:** $3\times 10^7m/s$
		- **Penetrating power (most strongly ionising):**

	- **Beta particle ($\beta$)**
		- **Made of:** 1 electron
		- **Charge:** $-1$
		- **Mass:** $1/1840\text{ amu}$

		- **Penetrating power (less strongly ionising):**
			- Paper: Passes through
			- Aluminium: Absorbed by a few millimetres
		- **Decay example:** $C_6^{14}\rightarrow N_7^{14}+e_{-1}^0+\text{energy}$ ($n_0^1\rightarrow p_1^1+e_{-1}^0$)
	- **Gamma ray ($\gamma$)**
		- **Made of:** Electromagnetic radiation
		- **Charge:** $0$
		- **Mass:** $0\text{ amu}$
		- **Speed:** $3\times 10^8m/s$
		- **Penetrating power (least strongly ionising):**
			- Paper: Passes through
			- Aluminium: Passes through
			- Concrete: Absorbed by several metres
			- Lead: Absorbed by several centimetres
- **Ionisation** - When radiation knocks electrons out of atoms
- **Radioactive decay** - Process in which an unstable nucleus releases radiation to become more stable
	- **Unstable nucleus:** Due to excess protons or excess electrons
	- Random process, direction is also random
	- Not affected by external factors
	- When an $\alpha$ or $\beta$ particle is released, it becomes an atom of a different element
- **Activity** - The rate at which a radioactive source's nuclei decay
	- The activity of a source decreases over time
	- As nuclei decay, they become more stable and there are fewer unstable nuclei
- **Half-life** - The average time taken for half of the atoms in a sample to decay, or the time for its activity or count rate to halve.
- **Usage of radioisotopes**
	- **Smoke detectors** - Smoke prevents the ionisation of the air using Americium-241 $\alpha$ radiation
	- **Thickness measurement** - The penetration of $\beta$ radiation is used to detect the precise thickness of paper
	- **Cancer treatment** - $\gamma$ rays are used to destroy cancerous cells
	- **Food irradiation** - $\gamma$ rays kill microbes in food
	- **Sterilization** - $\gamma$ rays kill microbes on medical equipment
	- **Medicine** - Technetium-99 is injected into a patient's bloodstream and traced to find blockages
	- **Engineering** - Radioactive chemicals are added to water pipes to find leakages or contamination
- **Radiocarbon dating** - The process of counting the amount of radioactive carbon-14 (half life: 5700 years) atoms present in an object to determine its age
