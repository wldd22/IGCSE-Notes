- **Kinetic theory:**
	- As particles **heat up**:
		- They gain more kinetic energy (They move faster)
	- As particles **cool down**:
		- They lose kinetic energy (They move slower)
	- **Absolute zero** - Lowest possible temperature (particles have no kinetic energy)
		- $-273\degree C$
	- **Brownian motion** - The random movement of particles in the air or water due to collisions with the fast-moving particles
- **Temperature:**
	- The temperature of an object is the average kinetic energy of all its particles
	- **Celsius ($\degree C$):**
		- Defined by the melting and boiling points of water ($0\degree C$, $100\degree C$)
	- **Kelvin ($K$):**
		- The temperature in Celsius plus $273$, so that absolute zero is $0K$
- **Boyle's law:**
	- The **temperature**, **pressure**, and **volume** of a gas all affect each other
	- **Formula:** $P_1V_1=P_2V_2$ assuming $T$ is constant
		- $P$ = Pressure
		- $V$ = Volume
		- $T$ = Temperature
