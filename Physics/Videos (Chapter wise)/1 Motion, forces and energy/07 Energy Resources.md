- **Types of energy sources**
	- **Renewable energy**
		- **Types:**
			- **Solar**
				- A **solar panel** captures the sun's rays and converts some of the energy into electric energy
				- **Solar panel** - Made up of solar cells that convert sunlight to electricity
				- **Advantages:**
					- Low maintenance cost
					- Useful in remote locations
					- Convenient in hotter places
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Unreliable (reliant on sunlight)
					- Large area is needed
					- Expensive setup
			- **Wind**
				- A **wind turbine** spins due to the wind and generates electricity
				- **Advantages:**
					- Low maintenance cost
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Requires large area
					- Unreliable (reliant on wind)
					- Noise pollution
					- Expensive
			- **Hydroelectric**
				- Water stored behind a dam is released to spin turbines
				- **Advantages:**
					- Electricity can be generated as per demand
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Expensive setup and maintenance
					- Ruins some natural habitats
			- **Biomass**
				- Organic matter (like wood and biogas) is burnt to produce heat
				- **Advantages:**
					- Relatively cheap
					- Accessible
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- May cause air pollution
					- Can lead to deforestation
			- **Wave**
				- Kinetic energy from waves are used to generate electricity
				- **Advantages:**
					- Convenient in coastal regions
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Impossible in lack-locked regions
					- Unreliable (depends on wave height and speed)
			- **Geothermal**
				- Uses the heat in the interior of the earth to generate electricity
	- **Non-renewable energy**
		- **Types:**
			- **Fossil fuels (Coal, Oil, Natural gas)**
				- Dead trees and animals millions of years ago slowly get compressed under sediment and form coal after long periods of time
				- **Advantages:**
					- Easily accessible
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Bad for the environment (releases carbon dioxide/sulphur dioxide)
			- **Nuclear fuels**
				- Radioactive decay of nuclear materials is sped up to release energy faster in a process called nuclear fission
				- **Advantages:**
					- Relatively cheap
					- Concentrated resource
				- **Disadvantages:**
					- Expensive initial cost
					- Very dangerous power stations
