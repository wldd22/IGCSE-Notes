- **Moment** - The turning effect of a force around a **pivot**
	- **Pivot (or fulcrum)** - The fixed point around which a lever turns
	- **Formula:** $\text{Moment}=\text{Force}\times\text{Perpenticular distance}$
	- **Unit:** $Nm$
- **Beam** - Long rigid object pivoted at a point
	- Beam is balanced if the clockwise and anticlockwise moment are equal
- **Centre of Gravity** - In an object, the point at which the force of gravity appears to act
	- When the centre of gravity moves over the pivot point of an object, the object falls over
