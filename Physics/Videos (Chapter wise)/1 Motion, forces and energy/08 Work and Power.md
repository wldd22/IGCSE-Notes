- **Work done** - Amount of energy transferred
	- **Formula:** $W=Fd$
		- $W$ = Work done
		- $F$ = Force
		- $d$ = Distance moved by the force
	- **Unit:** Joules ($J$)
- **Power** - Rate at which work is done (or energy is transferred)
	- **Formula:** $P=\dfrac{W}{t}$
		- $P$ = Power
		- $W$ = Work done/Energy transferred
		- $t$ = Time
	- **Unit:** Watt ($W$)
	- **Efficiency** - Can be represented with power:
		- $\text{Efficiency}=\dfrac{\text{Useful power output}}{\text{Total power input}}$
