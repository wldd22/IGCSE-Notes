- **Effects of forces on objects**
	- Forces can change the size and shape of objects
	- **Elastic** objects return to their original shape when an external force is removed
	- **Metals** (usually) deform permanently when a force is applied
- **Springs**
	- Designed to stretch easily
	- **Load** - The force (usually weight) stretching the spring
	- **Extension** - The increased length of the spring when a load is attached
	- **Hooke's law** - The extension of a spring is proportional to the load applied to it, provided the **limit of proportionality** is not exceeded
		- **Formula (until the limit of proportionality):** $\text{Spring Constant}(k)=\dfrac{\text{Force}(F)}{\text{Extension}(X)}$
- **Pressure**
	- **Formula:** $\text{Pressure}(P)=\dfrac{\text{Force}(F)}{\text{Area}(a)}$
	- **Unit:** $N/m^2$, $Nm^{-2}$
	- **Pressure underwater**
		- Greater than in air, because water is denser than air
		- **Formula:** $\text{Pressure}(P)=\text{Liquid density}(\rho)\times\text{Gravitational field strength}(G)\times\text{Height}(h)$
