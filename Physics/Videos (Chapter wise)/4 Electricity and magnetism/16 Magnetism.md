- **Magnetic poles**
	- North pole, south pole
	- Opposite poles attract, like poles repel
- **Types of materials:**
	- **Non-magnetic materials** (example: plastic)
		- Not attracted by a magnet
		- Cannot be magnetised
	- **Magnetic materials**
		- Can be attracted/repelled
		- Can be magnetised
		- **Hard magnet** (example: steel)
			- Permanent magnet
			- Difficult to demagnetise
		- **Soft magnet** (example: soft iron)
			- Can be magnetised
			- Easy to demagnetise
- **Induced magnetism** - When a material is magnetised by being placed in a **magnetic field**
	- When a magnetic material is brought near the pole of a magnet, it becomes oppositely charged and attracts toward the magnet
- **Demagnetisation** - Removing the magnetism from a magnetic material
	- Can be done by heating the material, or striking it repeatedly
- **Magnetic field** - The region of space around a magnet or electric current in which a magnetic pole experiences a force
	- Field lines indicate which direction a north pole would be pulled
	- A stronger force is indicated by field lines close together
	- Field lines point from the north pole to the south pole
- **Electromagnets** - Coil of wire that behaves as a magnet when an electric current passes through it
	- Coil is sometimes called a solenoid
	- **To strengthen an electromagnet:**
		- Increase the current flowing through it
		- Increase the number of turns in the coil
		- Add soft iron core
