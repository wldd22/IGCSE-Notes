- **Static electricity** - Result of an imbalance between negative and positive charges in an object
	- **Using friction** (Example: Rubbing a plastic rod with a cloth)
		- Electrons move from the cloth to the rod
		- Both become charged
- **Types of materials:**
	- **Electrical conductors** (Examples: Gold, copper)
		- Materials that allow the flow of electrons
	- **Electrical insulators** (Examples: Glass, plastic)
		- Materials that inhibit the flow of electrons
- **Electric field** - The region of space in which an electric charge experiences a force
	- Field lines indicate which direction a positively charged particle would be pulled
	- A stronger force is indicated by field lines close together
	- Field lines point from the north pole to the south pole
- **Charge**
	- **Unit:** Coulomb ($C$)
