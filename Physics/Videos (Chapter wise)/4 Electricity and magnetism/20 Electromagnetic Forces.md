- **Magnetic field around a wire**
	- Current travelling in a wire forms a magnetic field around it
	- Coiling up the wire concentrates the field
		- This is used in solenoids
	- **Right hand rule** (thumbs up)
		- Thumb represents direction of current
		- Other fingers represent direction of magnetic field around wire
- **Solenoid**
	- Field lines are close together at the poles
	- Inside the coil, field lines are parallel (uniform field)
	- Polarity is reversed when current is reversed
- **Fleming's left hand rule**
	- **Hand position:** Thumb upwards, index finger forward, middle finger rightward
	- All fingers are perpendicular to each other
	- **Thumb** - Motion
	- **Index finger** - Magnetic field
	- **Middle finger** - Current
