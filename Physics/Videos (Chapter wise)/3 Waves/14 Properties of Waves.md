- **Waves**
	- Used to explain the behaviour of light, sound, and electromagnetic waves
	- **Properties of waves:**
		- **Wavelength** - The distance between two adjacent crests/troughs
			- **Formula:** $\lambda=\dfrac{v}{f}$
				- $\lambda$ = Wave length
				- $v$ = Wave speed
				- $f$ = Frequency
			- When wave speed changes, wavelength changes, not frequency
		- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement of a wave
			- Amount of energy transferred by the wave
		- **Frequency** - The number of complete wavelengths per second
			- **Formula:** $f=\dfrac{1}{T}=\dfrac{v}{\lambda}$
				- $f$ = Frequency
				- $T$ = Time period
				- $v$ = Wave speed
				- $\lambda$ = Wave length
		- **Time period** - The length of time for one complete wavelength
			- **Formula:** $T=\dfrac{1}{f}$
				- $T$ = Time period
				- $f$ = Frequency
		- **Wave speed** - Speed at which the crest/trough of a wave travels
			- Speed at which the wave transfers energy
			- **Formula:** $v=f\lambda$
				- $v$ = Wave speed
				- $f$ = Frequency
				- $\lambda$ = Wave length
	- **Types of waves:**
		- **Transverse**
			- The vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave
		- **Longitudinal**
			- The vibrations are parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
	- **Phenomena:**
		- **Wavefronts** - Lines indicating the crests, separated by wavelengths
		  **Types:**
			- **Reflection**
			- **Refraction**
				- Wave speed changes when it enters a different material
			- **Diffraction**
				- Wave spreads out as it travels through a gap or past the edge of an object
				- Diffraction is greatest when the width of the gap is equal to the wavelength of the waves being diffracted
- **Earthquakes**
	- **Two types of seismic waves:**
		- **Primary seismic waves (P-waves)**
			- Fast moving
			- Longitudinal
		- **Secondary seismic waves (S-waves)**
			- Slow moving
			- Transverse
