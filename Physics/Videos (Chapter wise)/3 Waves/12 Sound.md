- **Sound**
	- Caused by vibrations
	- Sound waves travel by vibrations in the air
		- There is no sound in a vacuum
	- Ear drums sense vibrations and therefore sounds
	- **Sound waves**
		- Longitudinal waves (particles vibrate in the same direction as the wave)
		- Series of alternating compressions and rarefactions
		- **Amplitude** - Loudness of the sound
		- **Frequency** - Pitch of the sound
	- **Speed of sound (approx.):**
		- In air: $330m/s$ - $350m/s$
		- In liquid: $1500m/s$
		- Changes based on the material, temperature, and humidity (of air)
- **Ultrasound**
	- The human ear cannot hear sounds with higher frequencies than $20\ 000Hz$
	- Some animals use ultrasound to communicate
	- **Uses:**
		- **Sonar**
			- Used to measure distance underwater
			- **Method:**
				- Ultrasound wave is sent and the time taken for it to return is recorded
				- This is used with the speed of sound in water to calculate depth
		- **Material testing**
			- Used to detect cracks inside materials
			- **Method:**
				- Ultrasound wave is sent through the material repeatedly
				- The time between returning waves is less when there are cracks
