- **The sun**
	- Medium mass star
	- **Composed of:**
		- 75% Hydrogen
		- 24% Helium
		- 1% Other elements
	- **Releases electromagnetic waves**
		- 40% Visible light
		- 50% Infrared radiation
		- 10% Ultraviolet light
- **Stars** - Celestial bodies that emit their own light and appear to shimmer
	- **Stable star** - A star which is balanced by inward gravitational force and outward radiation pressure, not collapsing, or expanding
		- Sustained by **nuclear fusion** (nuclei joining together)
- **Galaxy** - Cluster of solar systems held together by gravity
- **The Milky Way** - The galaxy containing our solar system
	- About 200 billion stars
- **Universe** - Consists of billions of galaxies
- **Doppler effect** - Change in frequency of a wave (like sound or light) when the source of the wave is moving in relation to the observer
	- Used to calculate the speed of galaxies moving away from or toward us
	- In light, causes red shift
	- **Red shift** - The shift in electromagnetic radiation towards longer frequencies (redder colours), when objects are moving away
- **The Big Bang Theory**
	- The theory that the universe started a single point and expanded from there
- **Hubble's law**
	- Distant galaxies are moving away from Earth with a speed, v, that is proportional to their distance, d, from Earth
	- **Formula:** $v = H_0d$
		- $v$ - Speed
		- $H_0$ - Hubble constant (approximately equal to $2.2\times 10^18\text{ per second}$)
		- $d$ - Distance
	- **Estimate for the age of the universe:** $\dfrac{1}{H_0}$
