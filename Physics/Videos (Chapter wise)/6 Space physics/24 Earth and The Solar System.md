- **Earth's movement**
	- **Rotation**
		- The Earth rotates on its own axis
		- This causes day and night
	- **Orbit**
		- The Earth orbits the sun every 365.25 days (approximately)
		- Earth's axis remains tilted throughout, causing different part of the Earth to have more or less sunlight at different times of years. This results in seasons.
- **The moon**
	- Orbits the Earth every 27.5 days
	- Reflects sunlight
	- Its position relative to the Earth changes, resulting in varying amounts of sunlight on it
		- This causes the phases of the moon
- **The solar system**
	- **Consists of:**
		- **The sun**
			- Keeps the planets and other celestial objects in orbit with a strong gravitational pull
		- **The eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)**
			- **Inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)**
				- Rocky planets
				- Before the asteroid belt
			- **Outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune**
				- Gas giants
				- Past the asteroid belt
			- Planet orbits are **elliptical**
			- **Eccentricity** - How stretched the ellipse is
			- **Orbital speed** - Speed a planet moves in orbit around a star
				- **Formula:** $v=\dfrac{2\pi r}{T}$
					- $v$ - Average orbital speed
					- $r$ - **Orbital radius** (The average distance of the planet from the star)
					- $T$ - **Orbital period** (Time taken for planet to complete one full orbit around the star)
		- **Dwarf planets**
		- **Moons that orbit the planets and dwarf planets**
		- **Asteroids and comets**
- **Distances in space**
	- Very large, so large unit is used
	- **Unit:** $\text{light year}$ (The distance travelled by light in one year)
