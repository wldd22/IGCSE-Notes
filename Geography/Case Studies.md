# Theme 1: Population and settlement

### Bangladesh: Over-Population

- **Population Density**: 1062/km² with 153 million people on a 147,000 km² area, making it 20 times the global average.
- **Resource Strain**: 40% underemployment, rural-to-urban migration stresses Dhaka (43000/km² population density).
- **Healthcare and Services**: Only one qualified doctor per 25,000 rural residents.
- **Causes of Growth**: High birth rate, infant mortality at 43/1000, illiteracy (73.91%), and lack of contraception.

### Australia: Under-Population

- **Population Density**: 3/km² over a vast 7.7 million km², with uneven distribution (e.g., fertile coasts).
- **Resource Abundance**: Exports coal, iron ore, and gold, yet many areas are uninhabited.
- **Challenges**: Worker shortage, fewer taxpayers, and limited innovation due to low population.
- **Quality of Life**: Positive net migration and low infant mortality rate (4/1000).

### .Russia: Low Population Growth

- **Natural Decline**: Birth rate 11/1000 vs death rate 13.5/1000, leading to -0.25% growth in 2017.
- **High Mortality**: Life expectancy gap (women: 77.6, men: 67.5) due to smoking, alcohol, and poverty.
- **Depopulation**: Rural regions abandoned; 8500 villages vacated since 2002.
- **Government Measures**: Parental Glory medal and financial aid for larger families.

### International Migration: Mexico to the USA

- **Scale**: Over 16 million Mexicans migrated to the USA since 1965, with 1 million annually.
- **Push Factors**: High crime rates (47,500 killed in 5 years), poor medical care (1 doctor per 1800).
- **Pull Factors**: Higher literacy (99% in the USA vs 55% in Mexico) and better healthcare (1 doctor per 400).
- **Impacts**: USA spends heavily on border control, while Mexico faces brain drain and gender imbalance.

### Japan: High Dependent Population

- **Aging Society**: 25% of the population is over 65; fertility rate at 1.25.
- **Causes**: High life expectancy (women: 89 years, men: 82 years) and fewer marriages.
- **Economic Impact**: Shrinking workforce (1% yearly) and increased dependency ratio.
- **Policy Responses**: Retirement age raised, and immigrant workers encouraged.

### .Canadian Northlands: Sparse Population

- **Extreme Climate**: Winter temperatures average -20°C; short summers hinder agriculture.
- **Permafrost Issues**: Frozen ground limits building and crop growth.
- **Transport Barriers**: Limited rail and road routes; reliance on air transport for many communities.

### China: Anti-Natalist Policy

- **Demographic Shift**: Fertility dropped from 5.7 (1970) to 1.57 (2015), with 400 million fewer births.
- **Policy Mechanisms**: One-child policy enforced with fines and incentives; exceptions for rural families and disabilities.
- **Issues**: Gender imbalance (30 million more men) and aging population ("Little Emperor Syndrome").

### .France: Pro-Natalist Policy

- **Population Growth**: Fertility rate increased from 1.67 (1992) to 2.0 (2015).
- **Policy Incentives**: Cash benefits (£675/month for a year after third child), subsidized childcare, and tax breaks.
- **Impact**: Workforce expanded, but higher healthcare costs and lower disposable income arose.

# Theme 2: The natural environment

### Christchurch Earthquake (2010-2012)

- **Magnitude and Causes**: 2010 quake had a magnitude of 7.1 at a depth of 10 km; occurred at a destructive plate boundary (Pacific and Indo-Australian plates).
- **Major Impacts**: 2011 aftershock (magnitude 6.3) killed 185 people, caused $33 billion in damage, and liquefaction created 400,000 tonnes of silt.
- **Infrastructure Damage**: 80% of water and sewer systems damaged, and 75% of the city lost power.
- **Rescue Efforts**: Over 40 rescue teams deployed; 5000 chemical toilets and 2000 portaloos provided.

### Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat

- **Eruption**: Dormant for over 100 years, it erupted in 1995, with the deadliest event in 1997 killing 23 people.
- **Destruction**: Plymouth, the capital, was abandoned, 75% of the island covered in ash, and the population dropped from 11,000 to 4,500.
- **Aid and Recovery**: £41 million in UK aid for short-term relief and £75 million for long-term development.
- **Tourism**: Volcano tours introduced, but transportation is limited due to the small airport capacity.

### River Ganga: Opportunities, Hazards, and Management

- **Opportunities**: Fertile alluvial soils support agriculture (6th largest rice producer), dense population, and water for irrigation and drinking.
- **Flood Hazards**: 57% of Bangladesh’s land flooded; impacts included 1,300 deaths, $1 billion in damage, and 7 million homes destroyed.
- **Causes of Flooding**: Deforestation, urbanisation, and poorly maintained defences combined with cyclones and Himalayan snowmelt.
- **Management**: Long-term efforts included 7 dams ($40 million), 5000 flood shelters, and 350 km of levees.

### .Holderness Coast, UK: Opportunities, Hazards, and Management

- **Erosion**: Erodes at 2m/year, among the fastest globally, due to soft boulder clay and strong longshore drift.
- **Opportunities**: Tourism at Flamborough Head, gas terminal at Easington (25% of UK’s gas), and fishing in Hull.
- **Hazards**: Coastal erosion threatens settlements like Hornsea and Withernsea; climate change increases flooding risks.
- **Management**: Sea walls, groynes, and rip rap protect settlements; protests occurred where protection was insufficient (e.g., Mapleton).

### Amazon Rainforest

- **Global Significance**: Covers 5.5 million km², generates 20% of the world’s oxygen, and houses 400 billion trees and 60,000 plant species.
- **Deforestation**: Since 1970, 91% of land cleared, primarily for cattle ranching (70%), logging, and agriculture.
- **Impacts**: Loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, reduced rainfall, and contribution to global warming (via slash-and-burn practices).
- **Vegetation Adaptations**: Buttress roots for stability, drip tips for shedding water, and fan-shaped leaves to capture sunlight.

### .Sonoran Desert

- **Location and Climate**: Covers 260,000 km² in the USA and Mexico; temperatures reach 48°C, with 76-500 mm annual rainfall.
- **Soil and Vegetation**: Fertile soils in valleys sustain agriculture, while cacti and legume trees have adaptations for water conservation.
- **Animal Adaptations**: Nocturnal animals like kangaroo rats and jackrabbits adapt to extreme heat and limited water.
- **Threats**: Droughts cause vegetation die-offs (e.g., cholla cacti mortality over 50% at low elevations during 2004-2005).

# Theme 3: Economic development

### Walmart: A Transnational Corporation

- **Global Presence**: Operates in 28 countries, with 11,000 outlets, $500 billion in revenue, and employs 2 million people.
- **Global Links**: Largest producer is China (exports $18 billion in goods to the USA in 2011), with production in Africa and Bangladesh.
- **Impacts**: Positives include job creation (e.g., 450 jobs from new stores in Argentina); negatives include low wages ($1/hour in China vs $6/hour in the USA).
- **Sustainability**: 20 stores in Puerto Rico use solar panels; donates to local health projects (e.g., $80,000 in Argentina).

### .Intensive Rice Farming: Lower Ganges Valley

- **Physical Inputs**: Year-round temperatures above 21°C, 2000 mm rainfall, and fertile alluvial soil from regular flooding.
- **Human Inputs**: Labour-intensive farming on small plots; manual effort for planting, weeding, and irrigation.
- **Processes and Outputs**: Two crop seasons annually; production requires 5000 litres of water per kg of rice.
- **Economic Role**: Rice constitutes 75% of the local diet and is critical to employment and food security.

### Sudan: Food Shortages

- **Severity**: 6 million people faced food insecurity in 2017, with famine declared in 2017 but temporarily contained.
- **Physical Causes**: Desertification, drought, and soil degradation; Khartoum receives only 161 mm annual rainfall.
- **Social and Political Factors**: High population growth (2.4%), civil wars, and poor governance exacerbate hunger.
- **Responses**: Aid from the UN, Red Cross, and WFP; FAO-supported agricultural rehabilitation projects provided seeds and water access.
