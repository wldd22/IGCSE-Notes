## Topic 28: The work of the sea

- Coasts are ever-changing
- **Coastal Erosion** - Sea wearing away the land
	- **Processes:**
		- **Hydraulic action** - Water is forced into cracks in the rock by the waves. It traps air inside causing the rocks to eventually break apart.
		- **Corrasion (or Abrasion)** - Particles of material carried by the waves crash and grind against the cliffs, causing erosion.
		- **Attrition** - Particles carried by the waves scrape against each other causing them to be broken up into smaller and rounder particles
		- **Solution (or Corrosion)** - The acids in seawater dissolve chalk and limestone cliffs. The resulting material produced is carried away by the waves.
	- **The amount and speed of coastal erosion depends on:**
		- The type of rocks that form the cliffs
		- The strength of the waves
		- The shape of the coastline
		- How sheltered or exposed to waves the coast is
- **Coastal Deposition** - Sea depositing material that has been worn away, to form new land
- **Types of waves:**
	- **Destructive waves**
		- Cause coastal erosion
		- Create steep beaches
	- **Constructive waves**
		- Cause coastal deposition
		- Create gently sloping beaches
- The **strength of a wave** is determined by:
	- **Wave height**
	- **Wave length**
- **Wave height and length** is dependant on:
	- The speed and length of time a wave has been moving
	- The distance of open sea over which the wind has blown (**Fetch**)

## Topic 29: Coastal landforms created by erosion

- **Bay** - Area of the coast with softer rock that has been eroded inward
- **Headland** - Protruding areas of hard rock on either side of a bay
	- Waves erode the rock face, forming cliffs
- **Wave-cut platform**
	- When waves erode a cliff, a notch (cut) may form at the bottom.
	- Eventually, after the notch grows big enough, the overhang above collapses down forming a wave cut platform.
- **Cave** - When a crack in the side of a cliff is eroded by waves, it grows larger, into a **cave**.
- **Arch** - A cave may grow deeper through a headland and out onto the other side. This is called an **arch**.
- **Stack** - An arch may grow larger until the overhang above collapses down forming a disjointed **stack**.
- **Stump** - A stack may be eroded down into a **stump**.
- **Discordant coastline** - A coastline where different rocks meet the coast at right angles
	- Forms headlands and bays
- **Concordant coastline** - A coastline where different rocks are parallel to the coastline

## Topic 30: Coastal landforms created by deposition

- **Longshore drift**
	- Forms coastal deposition features
	- Transports beach material along the coast using waves
	- Process:
		- When waves don't hit the coast at a right angle (They hit the beach from the same angle from which the **prevailing wind** approaches), their **swash** and **backwash** move in different directions
		- The swash is in the direction of the wave (due to the prevailing wind)
		- The backwash in the direction of the slope of the shore (due to gravity)
		- This causes the material eroded to follow a zigzag path and end up transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing wind
- **Spit** - A long, narrow stretch of sand and/or shingle, with one end attached to the mainland
- **Bar** - A spit that has stretched across a bay, linking two headlands
	- The area of water that was cut off from the sea is called a **lagoon**
- **Tombolo** - Forms when a beach or spit joins up with an offshore island
- **Barrier islands** - A bar that is detached from the headlands on one or both sides
- **Salt marsh** - A sheltered area, flooded at high tide, where silt collects behind a spit or bar
- **Sand dunes**
	- Sand grains are trapped and deposited against an obstacle (rubbish, rocks, driftwood etc) by wind, to form dunes
	- Sandy beaches are usually backed by sand dunes due to strong onshore winds which transports dried out, exposed sand

## Topic 31: Coastal reefs and mangrove swamps

- **Coral polyp** - A tiny animal that builds a protective calcium carbonate skeleton
	- Has a solid skeleton of limestone
	- **Requires:**
		- Warm water ($23\degree C$ to $25\degree C$)
		- Clear, shallow saltwater
		- Plenty of sunlight
- **Coral reef** - Community of living organisms
	- Very diverse ecosystem
	- Made up of plants, fish and other creatures
	- Found in tropical and sub-tropical seas between 30 degrees north and south of the equator
	- Where a large continuous mass of coral builds upwards and outwards from a rock base.
	- **Three types:**
		- **Fringing reef** - Coral platforms grow out to sea attached to the mainland. A shallow lagoon lies above them.
		- **Barrier reef** - Coral grows in a shallower area away from the mainland. The water between is too deep for coral to grow and forms a lagoon. These reefs form off-shore barriers along coastlines.
		- **Atoll** - These develop around islands. Fringing reefs grow in a circle attached to the land. Sea-level rise or subsidence of the land causes the coral to grow at the height of the rising sea level to reach the light. This eventually forms a ring of coral reefs with a lagoon replacing the island in the centre.
- **Mangrove swamp** - Area of vegetation
	- Found along sheltered tropical coastlines and estuaries between $32\degree N$ and $38\degree S$
	- Made up of different species of evergreen mangrove trees and other plants.
	- Home to a variety of species
- **Mangroves**
	- Halophytes (plants that need salty water to live)
	- Only grow in areas where:
		- The temperature remains above $20\degree C$
		- The seasonal temperature range doesn't exceed $5\degree C$
		- There are no strong waves or tidal currents
	- Able to withstand being covered twice a day by saltwater
	- Adapted to be able to survive in these conditions
	- Protect coastlines from erosion by acting as a natural barrier and flood defence
	- They filter pollutants from rivers and prevent sediment from reaching nearby coral reefs

## Topic 32: Hazards and opportunities

- **Opportunities along coasts:**
	- **Farming**: Fertile land near coasts supports abundant crop production.
	- **Ideal for building settlements**: Coastal areas are prime locations for establishing communities due to access to resources and trade.
	- **Ports**: Coasts are strategic sites for ports, facilitating global trade and transportation.
	- **Manufacturing** (convenient for imports and exports): Coastal locations streamline the movement of goods, boosting manufacturing efficiency.
	- **Fishing**: Coastal waters are rich in marine life, supporting robust fishing industries.
	- **Boating, Canoeing, Kayaking**: Coasts offer ideal conditions for recreational water activities like boating, canoeing, and kayaking.
	- **Tourism**: Scenic coastal regions attract tourists, driving local economies.

- **Hazards along coasts:**
	- **Tsunamis**: Coasts are vulnerable to tsunamis, posing significant risks to life and property.
	- Flooding: Coastal areas are prone to flooding, especially during storms and high tides.
	- **Hurricanes**: Coasts frequently face the destructive force of hurricanes, leading to widespread damage.
	- **Coastal erosion**: Natural and human activities contribute to the gradual erosion of coastlines, threatening infrastructure and ecosystems.

## Topic 33: Managing coastal erosion

- **Reasons to protect coasts:**
	- Populated coastal regions
	- Fragile ecosystems
- **Two types of protection against coastal erosion:**
	- **Hard engineering** - Using artificial, man-made structures
		- **Sea walls**: Vertical barriers constructed along the coast to reflect and absorb wave energy, preventing erosion and flooding but often expensive and visually intrusive.
		- **Groynes**: Wooden, stone, or concrete barriers built perpendicular to the shoreline to trap sand and reduce longshore drift, helping to maintain beaches but potentially causing erosion downstream.
		- **Rock armour (Riprap)**: Large boulders placed at the base of cliffs or along shorelines to dissipate wave energy and protect against erosion, commonly used due to their durability and natural appearance.
		- **Revetments**: Sloping structures made of wood, concrete, or rocks placed parallel to the shoreline to absorb wave energy and reduce erosion, typically less intrusive than sea walls but can require regular maintenance.
		- **Gabions**: Cages filled with rocks or other materials, stacked to form protective barriers that absorb wave energy and reduce erosion, often used in areas where space or budget constraints limit other options.
		- **Offshore breakwaters**: Structures placed offshore to break the force of waves before they reach the shore, helping to reduce erosion and protect coastlines, though they can alter sediment patterns.
	- **Soft engineering** - More sustainable, natural approach
		- **Beach nourishment**: The process of adding sand or sediment to beaches to combat erosion and maintain beach width, providing a more natural appearance and enhancing recreational value, though it requires ongoing maintenance.
		- **Managed retreat**: A strategy of allowing certain areas of the coastline to erode and flood naturally, often relocating infrastructure and communities, seen as a sustainable and long-term solution to rising sea levels.
