They produce and consume goods and services.\n\n\nWhat are the three fundamental questions that all economies face?\n\nWhat to produce?\nHow to produce?\nFor whom to produce?\n\n\nWhat is the difference between goods and services?\n\nGoods are physical items that can be produced, bought, and sold, like furniture, clothing, and stationary. Meanwhile, services are Intangible items that be provided and paid for, like haircuts, education, and concerts.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the private and public sector?\n\nThe private sector consists of the economic activity of private individuals and firms. Its main aim is to earn profit for its owners. Meanwhile, the public sector consists of economic activity directly involving the government. Its main aim is to provide a service.\n\n\nHow do economic goods differ from free goods?\n\nEconomic goods are goods that are limited in supply, like oil, wheat, and cotton. Meanwhile, free goods are goods that are unlimited in supply, like air, seawater, and sunlight.\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The factors of production\n\nWhat is meant by the term ‘factors of production’?\n\nFactors of production comprise of the resources required to produce a good or service\n\n\nWhat are the four factors of production?\n\nThe four factors of production are land, labour, capital, and enterprise.\n\n\nWhat are the various rewards for the factors of production?\n\nLand - Rent\nLabour - Wages and salaries\nCapital - Interest\nEnterprise - Profit\n\n\nWhat is the collective name for the four returns on the factors of production?\n\nThe collective name for the four returns on the factors of production is income.\n\n\nWhat is meant by the mobility of factors of production?\n\nThe mobility of factors of production is the extent to which factors of production (usually labour) can be changed for one another in the production process.\n\n\nHow does geographical mobility of factor resources differ from occupational mobility?\n\nGeographical mobility is defined as the extent to which labour is willing and able to move to different locations for employment purposes. Meanwhile, occupational mobility is the extent to which labour is able to move between jobs.\n\n\nWhat are the various causes of changes in the quantity and quality of factors of production?\n\nChanges in the quantity and quality of factors of production can arise due to various causes. Higher costs, such as increased labour costs from a national minimum wage, reduce demand for labour, while government policies like taxes, subsidies, and regulations influence production costs and incentives to work.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Opportunity cost\n\nHow is the term ‘opportunity cost’ defined?\n\nOpportunity cost is the cost of the next best opportunity forgone when making a decision.\n\n\nWhat might be the opportunity cost of a student studying IGCSE Economics?\n\nThe opportunity cost of choosing to study IGCSE Economics is another IGCSE subject they could be studying instead.\n\n\nWhy do consumers face opportunity costs in decision making?\n\nConsumers have limited incomes, so whenever they purchase a particular good or service, they give up the benefits of purchasing another product.\n\n\nWhy do workers face opportunity costs in decision making?\n\nWorkers tend to specialise in jobs. By choosing to specialise in a particular profession, workers give up the opportunity to pursue other jobs and careers.\n\n\nUsing an example, explain why producers (firms) face opportunity costs in decision making.\n\nProducers need to choose between competing business opportunities. For example, a company like Apple needs to choose between whether to put more money into developing the new iPhone or new MacBook.\n\n\nUsing an example, explain why governments face opportunity costs in decision making.\n\nGovernments need to choose where to allocate resources and money to achieve the best outcome. For example, if a government spends a lot of money repairing an old road, they can’t use that money on something else, like constructing a new hospital.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Production possibility curve\n\nWhat is meant by productive capacity?\n\nProductive capacity is the maximum combination of goods or services possible to produce in an economy.\n\n\nWhat does a production possibility curve diagram show?\n\nThe production possibility curve shows the productive capacity, at a point of time.\n\n\nHow is the concept of opportunity cost shown on a PPC diagram?\n\nMovements along the PPC incur an opportunity cost.\n\n\nWhich two conditions must hold for an economy to be operating on its PPC?\n\nWhen an economy is on the PPC, that means all its resources are being used (there is no unemployment of factors of production) and that there is efficiency in the use of resources (factors of production are allocated to their best use/purpose)\n\n\nWhat are the causes of a shift of the PPC?\n\nAn outward shift is caused by an increase in quantity and/or quality of the factors of production. An inward shift is caused by a decrease in quantity and/or quality of the factors of production.\n\n\n"},"Economics/Chapter-Review-Questions/Section-2---The-allocation-of-resources":{"slug":"Economics/Chapter-Review-Questions/Section-2---The-allocation-of-resources","filePath":"Economics/Chapter Review Questions/Section 2 - The allocation of resources.md","title":"Section 2 - The allocation of resources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 5: Microeconomics and macroeconomics\n\nWhat is meant by microeconomics?\n\nMicroeconomics is the study of particular markets and sections of the economy, rather than the economy as a whole.\n\n\nWhat is meant by macroeconomics?\n\nMacroeconomics is the study of economic behaviour and decision-making of the whole economy, rather than individual markets.\n\n\nWho are the main decision makers in microeconomics, and how does this differ from the decision makers in macroeconomics?\n\nMicroeconomics is concerned with decision making by individuals, households, and firms, while, macroeconomics is concerned with decision making for the economy as a whole.\n\n\nWho are the decision makers affected by microeconomics?\n\nMicroeconomics affects decision makers such as individuals, households, and firms\n\n\nWho are the decision makers affected by macroeconomics?\n\nMacroeconomics affects decision makers such as governments, the population as a whole, and international organizations.\n\n\n\nChapter 6: The role of markets in allocating resources\n\nWhat is meant by the market system?\n\nThe market system refers to the method of allocating scarce resources through the market forces of demand and supply.\n\n\nWhat is meant by market equilibrium?\n\nMarket equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers at a specific price, resulting in no surplus or shortage.\n\n\nHow does market disequilibrium occur?\n\nMarket disequilibrium occurs when the price is either above or below the equilibrium price, leading to either excess supply or excess demand.\n\n\nWhat are the three key economic questions that all economies must address?\n\nWhat to produce?\nHow to produce?\nFor whom to produce?\n\n\nWhat is the price mechanism?\n\nThe price mechanism is the system where the forces of demand and supply interact to determine prices and allocate resources without government intervention​\n\n\nWhat are the key features of the price mechanism?\n\nNo government interference in economic activity\nThe allocation of resources being based on price and financial incentives\nCompetition that creates choice and opportunities for firms and private individuals\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Demand\n\nWhat is meant by demand?\n\nDemand refers to both the willingness and ability of customers to pay a given price to buy a good or service\n\n\nWhat is the law of demand?\n\nThe law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded. As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa\n\n\nWhat are the two reasons for the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded?\n\nWhen the price of a good or service falls, the customer is able to buy of the product for the same cost\nWhen the price of a good or service rises, the customer is able to buy of the product for the same cost\n\n\nWhat are the main determinants of demand?\n\nHabits, fashions, and tastes\nIncome\nSubstitutes and complements\nAdvertising\nGovernment policies\nEconomy\n\n\nHow does a movement along a demand curve differ from a shift in the demand curve?\n\nA movement along the demand curve occurs due to a change in the price of the product, while a shift in the demand curve happens due to changes in non-price factors like income or preferences\n\n\nHow does a contraction in demand differ from an extension in demand?\n\nA contraction in demand refers to a fall in the quantity demanded following a price increase, while an extension in demand refers to an increase in quantity demanded following a price reduction\n\n\nWhat is meant by market demand?\n\nMarket demand is the total of all individual demand for a product at each price level\n\n\nHow does a fall in quantity demanded differ from a fall in demand?\n\nA fall in quantity demanded is caused by an increase in the price of the product, leading to movement along the demand curve. A fall in demand, however, is caused by changes in non-price factors, resulting in a leftward shift of the demand curve​\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Supply\n\nWhat is meant by supply?\n\nSupply refers to the ability and willingness of firms to provide goods and services at given price levels\n\n\nWhy is the supply curve upward sloping?\n\nThe supply curve is upward sloping because there is a positive relationship between price and the quantity supplied. As prices increase, firms are more willing to supply more to maximize profits\n\n\nWhat are the main determinants of supply?\n\nPrice\nTime\nWeather\nOpportunity cost\nTaxes\nInnovations\nProduction costs\nSubsidies\n\n\nWhat is the law of supply?\n\nThe law of supply states that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied. As the price increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa\n\n\nHow does a contraction in supply differ from an extension in supply?\n\nA contraction in supply occurs when the quantity supplied decreases due to a fall in price, while an extension in supply occurs when the quantity supplied increases due to a price rise\n\n\nHow does market supply differ from individual supply?\n\nIndividual supply refers to the supply provided by a single firm at each price level, while market supply is the total supply of a product provided by all firms in the market at each price level\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a movement along a supply curve and a shift in a supply curve?\n\nA movement along the supply curve is caused by a change in the price of the good, while a shift in the supply curve occurs due to changes in non-price factors like production costs or technological advances\n\n\nWhat are the causes of shifts in the supply curve?\n\nA change in non-price factors affecting the supply of a good or service will cause a shift in the supply curve\n\n\n\nChapter 9: Price determination\n\nWhat is meant by market equilibrium?\n\nMarket equilibrium is the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, resulting in no excess demand or supply\n\n\nWhat is meant by equilibrium price?\n\nThe equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded by customers equals the quantity supplied by suppliers\n\n\nWhat is meant by market disequilibrium?\n\nMarket disequilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are not equal, leading to shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply)​\n\n\nWhat is the difference between excess demand and excess supply?\n\nExcess demand occurs when the price is below equilibrium, causing more demand than supply. Meanwhile, excess supply occurs when the price is above equilibrium, leading to more supply than demand\n\n\nWhen do surpluses occur?\n\nSurpluses occur when the price of a good is set above the equilibrium price, causing supply to exceed demand\n\n\nWhen do shortages occur?\n\nShortages occur when the price is set below the equilibrium price, causing demand to exceed supply\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Price changes\n\nWhich factors cause a change in the equilibrium price and quantity traded?\n\nChanges in non-price factors that affect demand or supply will cause a change in the equilibrium price and quantity\n\n\nWhat is the consequence of sales taxes on equilibrium price and quantity?\n\nThe imposition of a sales tax shifts the supply curve to the left, leading to an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the quantity traded\n\n\nWhat is the impact of favourable weather conditions on the equilibrium price and quantity of agricultural output?\n\nFavourable weather conditions shift the supply curve for agricultural products to the right, reducing the equilibrium price and increasing the quantity traded\n\n\nState three factors that can shift the demand curve.\n\nHabits, fashions, and tastes\nIncome\nSubstitutes and complements\n\n\nState three factors that can shift the supply curve.\n\nTime\nWeather\nOpportunity cost\n\n\n\nChapter 11: Price elasticity of demand\n\nWhat is meant by price elasticity of demand (PED) and how is it calculated?\n\nPrice elasticity of demand (PED) is the degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a product following a change in its price. It is calculated using the formula E_D = \\frac{\\%ΔQ_D}{\\%ΔP}\n\n\nWhy should firms raise prices for products with price inelastic demand, and reduce prices for products with price elastic demand?\n\nWhen demand is price inelastic, firms increasing their prices will not decrease demand too much and the overall sales revenue will increase. When demand is price elastic, firms decreasing their prices will increase demand quickly so their sales revenue will increase.\n\n\nUse a diagram to show the difference between perfectly price elastic demand, unitary PED and price inelastic demand.\nWhat are the key determinants of PED?\n\nThe key determinants of PED are time, habits and tastes, income and substitution.\n\n\nHow might knowledge of PED be of value to producers (firms)?\n\nFirms can choose to change their prices based on the PED to increase their overall sales revenue.\n\n\nHow might knowledge of PED be of value to the government?\n\nThe government can use their knowledge of the PED of certain goods to determine their taxation policies. For example, increasing taxes on demerit goods.\n\n\n\nChapter 12: Price elasticity of supply\n\nWhat is meant by price elasticity of supply (PES) and how is it calculated?\n\nPrice elasticity of supply (PES) is the degree of responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a product following a change in its price. It is calculated using the formula E_S = \\frac{\\%ΔQ_S}{\\%ΔP}\n\n\nUse a diagram to show the difference between perfectly price elastic supply, unitary PES, and price inelastic supply.\nUse a diagram to distinguish between price elastic PES and price inelastic PES.\nWhat are the key determinants of PES?\n\nThe key determinants of PES are spare capacity, inventory (stock) levels, the number of firms in the industry, the ease and the cost of factor substitution, and the time period.\n\n\nIf a product has a PES value of 0, what does this actually mean? What about \\text{PES}=1 and \\text{PES}=\\infty?\n\nA PES value of 0 means the supply is perfectly price inelastic, that is, a change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied.\nA PES value of 1 means the supply has unitary price elasticity, that is, the percentage change in the quantity supplied is proportional to the change in price.\nA PES value of \\infty means the supply is perfectly price elastic, that is, the quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic supply?\n\nA PES that is perfectly price inelastic means that a change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied. Meanwhile, a PES that is perfectly price elastic means that the quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.\n\n\nHow might knowledge of PES be of value to producers (firms)?\n\nProducers can use PES to plan production and manage inventory effectively, particularly for goods with inelastic supply, where responding to price changes takes time. It helps them set pricing strategies, maximizing profit when supply is inelastic and adjusting quickly when supply is elastic. Additionally, PES helps manage risks during market changes, ensuring efficient responses to demand fluctuations. Firms can also use PES to decide on entering markets or developing products where supply flexibility offers competitive advantages.\n\n\nHow might knowledge of PES be of value to the government?\n\nThe government can use PES to predict the effects of taxation and subsidies, knowing that goods with inelastic supply are less likely to face shortages after taxation, while subsidies on elastic goods can boost output significantly. During crises, understanding PES helps governments ensure the availability of essential goods by focusing on non-price mechanisms for inelastic supplies. In long-term planning, PES aids in prioritizing infrastructure and policies that support industries needing supply adaptability.\n\n\n\nChapter 13: Market economic system\n\nWhat is meant by an economic system?\n\nAn economic system is the way in which an economy is organised and run including different views of how scarce resources are best allocated.\n\n\nWhat are the three main types of economic system?\n\nPlanned economy\nMixed economy\nMarket economy\n\n\nWhat are the key features of the market economic system?\n\nA market economy relies on the market forces of demand and supply (in the private sector) to allocate resources with minimal government intervention.\n\n\nWhat are the advantages of operating a market economy?\n\nAdvantages of the market economy include: efficiency in the use and allocation of resources, freedom of choice and incentives to work\n\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of operating a market economy?\n\nDisadvantages of the market economy include: income and wealth inequalities, environmental degradation, depletion of non-renewable resources, social hardship and wasteful competition.\n\n\n\nChapter 14: Market Failure\n\nWhen and why does market failure occur?\n\nMarket failure occurs when the market forces of demand and supply are unsuccessful in allocating resources efficiently.\n\n\nGive three examples of market failure.\n\nA lack of government intervention causes demerit goods like cigarettes to be overproduced and overconsumed.\nThe government is forced to provide street lighting and roads since firms are unwilling to provide them.\nHospitals increase prices on their services to increase their profit, causing negative spillover effects.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between private external and social costs?\n\nPrivate costs are the actual costs of a firm, individual, or government. External costs are negative side effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties for which no compensation is paid. Social cost is the sum of them both.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between private external and social benefits?\n\nPrivate benefits are benefits of production and consumption enjoyed by a firm, individual, or government. External benefits are the positive side effects of production or consumption experienced by third parties for which no money is paid by the beneficiary. Social benefit is the sum of them both.\n\n\nWhat are public goods?\n\nPublic goods are goods that the private sector fails to provide due to a lack of profit motive.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between merit and demerit goods?\n\nMerit goods are goods that have social benefits but are under-provided and under-consumed without government intervention or provision. Meanwhile, goods that have social costs when consumed or produced but are over-produced and over-consumed without government intervention.\n\n\nWhat are the social benefits of public provision of education?\n\nPublic provision of education leads to increased literacy, higher productivity, and improved economic growth. It creates positive externalities like reduced crime rates, improved public health, and more informed citizens who contribute to societal development.\n\n\nWhat is meant by the abuse of monopoly power?\n\nThe abuse of monopoly power occurs when a monopolist exploits its market dominance to restrict output, raise prices, or limit competition, leading to reduced consumer welfare and allocative inefficiency in the market.\n\n\nHow does factor immobility cause market failure?\n\nFactor immobility occurs when resources such as labour, capital, or land cannot move easily between industries or locations. This leads to underutilisation or misallocation of resources, causing inefficiencies and market failure.\n\n\nDistinguish between occupational and geographic mobility.\n\nOccupational mobility occurs when it is difficult to move a factor of production from one type of work or job role to another. Meanwhile, geographic mobility occurs when it is difficult to move a factor of production from one geographical location to another\n\n\n\nChapter 15: Mixed economic system\n\nWhat is meant by a mixed economic system?\n\nA mixed economic system is a combination between planned and market economies. The degree of public and private sector involvement in economic activities is determined by the government.\n\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of operating a mixed economic system?\n\nThe positives and negatives of a mixed economic system depend on whether is closer to a planned or market economy and by how much. This is controlled by the government. Mixed economies have a balance between private enterprise and government intervention allowing for efficiency and social welfare. A mixed economy may also have disadvantages like potential inefficiencies from overregulation and conflicts between public and private sector goals.\n\n\nWhat is meant by a maximum price, and why might governments impose this?\n\nA maximum price is a price ceiling set below the market equilibrium to make essential goods more affordable. Governments impose it to protect consumers from excessively high prices, especially for necessities like food and housing.\n\n\nWhat is meant by a minimum price, and why might governments impose this?\n\nA minimum price is a price floor set above the market equilibrium to ensure fair income for producers. Governments impose it to support industries with underpaid work or to discourage harmful consumption, such as alcohol.\n\n\nWhy might a national minimum wage, set above the market equilibrium, cause unemployment?\n\nA minimum wage above the equilibrium increases labour costs, leading firms to hire fewer workers, potentially creating excess supply of labour and unemployment.\n\n\nHow does indirect taxation work to correct certain market failures?\n\nIndirect taxation is the act of imposing taxes on specific products (usually demerit goods) to reduce demand.\n\n\nHow might subsidies be used to correct certain market failures?\n\nA subsidy is government financial assistance to reduce prices and increase demand\n\n\nHow might the use of rules and regulation help to correct certain market failures?\n\nGovernments may use rules and regulations to decrease consumption or production of demerit goods or increase consumption or production of merit goods\n\n\nHow might the use of education and advertising reduce the consumption of cigarettes?\n\nGovernments may mandate that schools teach students about the negative side effects of demerit goods and positive side effects of merit goods.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between privatisation and nationalisation with regard to the correction of market failure?\n\nNationalisation is the purchase of private sector assets by the government, while privatisation is the transfer of the ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector. A government may choose to privatise a business for various reasons like: to reduce government debt (they won’t have to maintain the business anymore), to earn the one-time privatisation proceeds from the sale, to allow the business to be more competitive in the market, etc.\n\n\n"},"Economics/Chapter-Review-Questions/Section-3---Microeconomic-decision-makers":{"slug":"Economics/Chapter-Review-Questions/Section-3---Microeconomic-decision-makers","filePath":"Economics/Chapter Review Questions/Section 3 - Microeconomic decision makers.md","title":"Section 3 - Microeconomic decision makers","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 16 - Money and banking\n\nWhat is meant by money?\n\nMoney is any commodity that can be used as medium of exchange for the purchase of goods or services.\n\n\nWhat are the various forms of money?\n\nThe three main forms of money are cash, bank deposits, and central bank reserves.\n\n\nWhat are the key functions of money?\n\nMedium of exchange\nMeasure of value / Unit of account\nStore of value\nStandard of deferred payment\n\n\nWhat are the main characteristics of money?\n\nDurability\nAcceptability\nDivisibility\nUniformity\nScarcity\nPortability\n\n\nWhat is a central bank?\n\nA central bank is the monetary authority that oversees and manages the economy’s money supply and banking system.\n\n\nWhat are the key functions of a central bank?\n\nThe sole issuer of banknotes and coins\nThe government’s bank\nThe banker’s bank\nThe lender of last resort\n\n\nHow does a central bank differ from commercial banks?\n\nA central bank is the monetary authority that oversees and manages the economy’s money supply and banking system. Meanwhile, a commercial bank is a retail bank that also provides financial services to its customers.\n\n\nWhat are the main functions of commercial banks?\n\nAccepting deposits\nMaking advances\nCredit creation\n\n\n\nChapter 17 - Households\n\nWhat are the main factors that affect the level of consumer spending in an economy?\n\nIncome\nInterest rates\nConfidence levels\nInflation\nAge\nSize of households\n\n\nHow will the spending, borrowing and saving patterns of a young family with two children under the age of 5 compare with those of an old-aged pensioner?\n\nA family with multiple children will have a greater income than an old-aged pensioner. However, they would also have much high spending overall, and would not be able to save much. An old-aged pensioner would have a low income, low spending, and would likely borrow money.\n\n\nHow do spending and saving patterns of low income earners differ from those of high income earners?\n\nLow income earners spend most of their income on necessities, while high income earners spend a smaller portion of their income on them and can spend on luxuries. Low income earners usually can’t save much since they have less disposable income, unlike high income earners who are able to save more.\n\n\nHow does wealth affect a person’s level of spending, saving and borrowing?\n\nWealthier individuals tend to have higher levels of disposable income, which allows them to spend more on both necessities and luxuries. They can save a larger portion of their income due to financial stability and are less likely to borrow. In contrast, less wealthy individuals may have to borrow more to meet basic needs and have limited capacity for saving.\n\n\nHow do changes in interest rates influence consumer spending, saving and borrowing?\n\nHigher interest rates discourage borrowing as the cost of loans increases, and they encourage saving due to better returns on savings accounts. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, leading to increased consumer spending, while the incentive to save diminishes.\n\n\nWhat are the main determinants of the level of savings in an economy?\n\nThe level of savings depends on factors like income levels, interest rates, inflation, government policies, and consumer confidence. Higher disposable income and favourable interest rates encourage saving, while economic uncertainty or high inflation often leads to reduced saving.\n\n\nWhat factors affect the level of borrowing in an economy?\n\nBorrowing levels are influenced by interest rates, consumer confidence, income levels, inflation, and access to credit. Low interest rates and economic optimism encourage borrowing, while high interest rates, low incomes, and restrictive lending policies suppress it.\n\n\nWhy might one person save more of their income than another?\n\nDifferences in saving habits arise due to factors like income levels, financial goals, age, and risk tolerance. Higher earners or individuals with fewer financial obligations can save more. Additionally, those with a cautious financial outlook or long-term goals prioritize saving over spending.\n\n\n\nChapter 18 - Workers\n\nHow do wage and non-wage factors differ, regarding a worker’s choice of occupations?\n\nWage factors are financial rewards received by workers in exchange for their labour services. Meanwhile, non-wage factors are rewards received by workers that are not monetary.\nGenerally, skilled workers get more overall earnings than unskilled workers due to their relatively high demand and low supply. There is a large supply of unskilled workers, so they usually earn less.\nUsually primary sector workers earn the least, since most of their work is unskilled. Additionally, the wages paid to workers is usually dependant on the cost of the product produced. Primary sector workers normally produce products with low sales values. Similarly, tertiary sector workers usually provide services with greater cost values, so they earn more, in general.\nWorkers in the private sector usually earn more money than workers in the public sector, since firms in the private sector aim for profit maximisation. Also, men are generally paid more than women.\n\n\nWhat are fringe benefits?\n\nFringe benefits (or perks) are additional benefits (with monetary value)\n\n\nHow are wages determined?\n\nWages are determined based on the following factors:\n\nDemand for labour\nSupply for labour\nEquilibrium wage rate\nRelative bargaining power\nMinimum wage\n\n\n\n\nWhat is meant by the demand for labour, and what are the factors that affect the demand for labour?\n\nThe demand for labour is the number of workers that firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate. The factors that affect demand for labour are: the level of total demand in the economy, the productivity of labour, the cost of labour.\n\n\nWhat is derived demand?\n\nDerived demand is demand for a factor of production that is not demanded for itself but for the goods and services it is used to produce.\n\n\nWhat is meant by the supply of labour, and what are the factors that affect the supply of labour?\n\nThe supply of labour is everyone in an economy who is of working age and is both willing and able to work at a specific wage rate. The factors that affect supply of labour are: labour force participation rate, availability and level of welfare benefits, changing social attitudes, geographical mobility, occupational mobility.\n\n\nWhy might the supply of labour curve be backward bending after a certain wage rate is reached?\n\nThe supply of labour curve bends backwards when wage rates rise to a high enough point to allow people to work less and enjoy more leisure hours.\n\n\nHow are wages determined in a market economy?\n\nWages in a market economy are determined by the forces of demand and supply for labour. The equilibrium wage rate is established where the demand for labour (from firms) equals the supply of labour (from workers). Factors like worker productivity, skill levels, and bargaining power can shift these forces, affecting wage levels.\n\n\nHow might a national minimum wage affect the demand for and supply of labour?\n\nA national minimum wage increases the lowest possible wage workers can receive. It leads to overall higher incomes for workers but can reduce the demand for labour as firms face higher costs. On the other hand, it can increase the supply of labour as more individuals are incentivized to work due to higher pay.\n\n\nWhat are the various factors that influence differences in earnings between workers?\n\nWorkers may have differences in earnings due to varying skill levels, qualifications, experience, gender, and industry type. Additionally, workers in high-demand, low-supply occupations or in sectors generating higher revenues typically earn more.\n\n\nHow do the division of labour and specialisation of labour improve productivity and efficiency?\n\nDivision of labour and specialisation allow workers to focus on specific tasks, reducing training time and improving expertise. This leads to faster production, lower costs, and greater efficiency. It also enables firms to produce higher-quality goods and services at scale.\n\n\n\nChapter 19 - Trade Unions\n\nWhat is meant by a trade union?\n\nA trade union (or labour union) is an organisation that aims to protect the interests of its worker members.\n\n\nWhy might a worker join a trade union?\n\nWorkers would want to join trade unions to help settle conflicts between employers and employees over wages, working conditions, non-wage benefits, etc.\n\n\nHow do the aims and objectives of employees differ from those of employers?\n\nEmployers generally want to maximise profits, minimise costs, and maximise sales. Meanwhile, employees generally want to maximise wages/salaries, work in a safe and healthy environment, have good terms and conditions at work, maximise their non-wage benefits, have job security at work.\n\n\nWhat are the main types of trade union?\n\nThe four major types of trade unions are craft unions, industrial unions, white collar unions, and general unions.\n\n\nWhat are the main roles of trade unions?\n\nA trade union’s primary role is to protect the interests of its members. Other than that, trade unions also bargain with employers, ensure their members safety at work, provide legal advice and support to workers, and persuade governments to pass legislation in favour of workers.\n\n\nWhat is meant by the collective bargaining process?\n\nCollective bargaining is the process of trade union representatives negotiating on behalf of their worker members with employer representatives for better pay and conditions.\n\n\nWhat is meant by industrial action and why might it occur?\n\nIndustrial action is a measure taken by trade union members as a result of major disagreements or disputes with their employers.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of industrial action?\n\nThe main types of industrial action are:\n\nStrike\nWork-to-rule\nGo-slow\nSit-in\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors influence the strength of trade unions?\n\nThe main factors affecting the strength of trade unions is the number of members and the degree of their unity.\n\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of trade unions?\n\nAdvantages: Trade unions protect workers’ rights, ensure fair wages, and improve working conditions. They provide a collective voice for employees, making it easier to negotiate with employers. Trade unions also offer legal support and advocate for policies that benefit workers.\nDisadvantages: Trade unions can cause disruptions through industrial actions like strikes, impacting productivity and businesses. They may also demand higher wages, increasing costs for employers, which could lead to job losses. Additionally, union membership fees can be a financial burden for workers.\n\n\n\nChapter 20 - Firms\n\nWhat are the differences between the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy?\n\nThe primary sector consists of firms that extract raw materials from the earth.\nThe secondary sector consists of firms that manufacture goods, or construct buildings, roads, and bridges.\nThe tertiary sector consists of firms that provide services to the general public and other firms.\n\n\nWhy are the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors said to be interdependent?\n\nInterdependence is due the fact that firms cannot operate without using goods and services from all three sectors of industry to make and sell its goods or services to the final customer.\n\n\nHow does the private sector differ from the public sector?\n\nThe private sector is owned by private individuals and owners. While the public sector is owned by the government.\n\n\nHow might the size of firms be measured?\n\nThe size of firms can be measured based on the number of employees, the firm’s market share, the market capitalisation of a firm, or sales revenue of a firm.\n\n\nWhy do so many small firms exist?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of small firms?\nHow does internal growth differ from external growth?\nWhat is the difference between a merger and a takeover?\nHow do horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers differ from each other?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of a merger?\nHow do economies of scale differ from diseconomies of scale?\nHow do internal and external economies of scale differ from each other?\nWhat is a demerger and why might it occur?\n\nChapter 21 - Firms and production\n\nWhat are factors of production, and what are the four factors of production?\nWhy is the demand for factors of production a derived demand?\nHow does labour-intensive output differ from capital-intensive output?\nWhat are the factors that determine whether firms are capital intensive or labour intensive?\nHow does production differ from productivity?\nWhy is higher productivity important for an economy?\nWhat are the main determinants of productivity?\n\nChapter 22 - Firms’ costs, revenue and objectives\n\nWhat is meant by cost of production?\nWhat is the difference between total, average, fixed and variable costs of production?\nHow might the average cost of production change when the level of output changes?\nWhat is the difference between total and average revenue?\nWhat are the objectives (goals) that businesses might have?\nHow is profit calculated?\nWhy is survival an important goal for firms?\nWhat is profit maximisation?\nWhy do most firms aim for growth?\nWhy do some firms have social welfare as a goal?\n\nChapter 23 - Market structure\n\nWhat is meant by market structure?\nWhat are barriers to entry?\nWhat are the main characteristics of competitive markets?\nWhat are the effects of competitive markets on price, quality, choice and profit?\nWhat is meant by a monopoly?\nWhat are the main characteristics of a monopoly?\nWhat are the advantages of monopoly?\nWhat are the disadvantages of monopoly?\n"},"Economics/Notes/Section-1---The-basic-economic-problem":{"slug":"Economics/Notes/Section-1---The-basic-economic-problem","filePath":"Economics/Notes/Section 1 -

Higher income may make demand less elastic for basic goods, while lower income might increase elasticity as consumers become more price-sensitive.\nNecessity: Necessities tend to have inelastic demand because consumers need to purchase them regardless of price changes, whereas luxury goods often have more elastic demand.\nHabits, Addictions, Fashions, and Tastes: Strong consumer preferences or addictions can make demand inelastic, as people continue to buy despite price increases. Conversely, fashion trends can make demand more elastic as they change rapidly.\nAdvertising and Brand Loyalty: Effective advertising and strong brand loyalty can make demand more inelastic, as consumers are less likely to switch to competing products even if prices rise.\nTime: Over time, demand can become more elastic as consumers find alternatives or change their consumption habits. In the short term, demand is often less elastic.\nDurability: Durable goods, which are long-lasting, tend to have more elastic demand because consumers can postpone purchases during price increases.\nThe Costs of Switching: If switching costs are high, demand is likely to be inelastic, as consumers are reluctant to change to a new product due to additional expenses or effort.\nThe Breadth of Definition of the Product: Products defined broadly tend to have more inelastic demand because substitutes are less readily available, while narrowly defined products face more elastic demand due to more specific substitutes.\n\n\nSales revenue (or total revenue) - The sum of money received from the sale of a good or service.\n\nSales revenue = price × quantity demanded\n\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice ChangeInelastic demandUnitary demandElastic demandIncrease priceRevenues riseNo change in revenuesRevenues fallReduce priceRevenues fallNo change in revenuesRevenues rise^ Relationship between PED and sales revenues ^\n\nSignificance of price elasticity of demand for decision makers\n\nHelping producers to decide on their pricing strategy\nPredicting the impact on producers to impose sales taxes on\nDetermining taxation policies\n\n\n\nChapter 12: Price elasticity of supply\n\n\nPrice elasticity of supply (PES / E_S) - the degree of responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a product following a change in its price.\n\nFormula: E_S = \\frac{\\%ΔQ_S}{\\%ΔP} = \\text{percentage change in quantity supplied} \\div \\text{percentage change in price}\nPES will be positive because of the law of supply\n\n\n\nInterpretation of PES\n\n\\text{PES}&lt;1 - Price inelastic - Quantity supplied is less responsive to price changes.\n\\text{PES}&gt;1 - Price elastic - Quantity supplied is more responsive to price changes.\n\\text{PES}=0 - Perfectly price inelastic - A change in price has no impact on the quantity supplied.\n\\text{PES}=\\infty - Perfectly price elastic - Quantity supplied can change without any corresponding change in price.\n\\text{PES}=1 - Unitary price elasticity - Percentage change in the quantity supplied is proportional to the change in price.\n\n\n\nDeterminants of PES\n\nThe Degree of Spare Productive Capacity: When firms have spare capacity, they can increase production quickly in response to price increases, making supply more elastic.\nThe Level of Stocks: High levels of stock or inventory allow producers to respond more flexibly to changes in price, increasing supply elasticity.\nThe Number of Producers in the Industry: A greater number of producers can make supply more elastic, as increased competition encourages producers to respond to price changes more readily.\nThe Time Period: Supply is usually more elastic over the long term because producers have more time to adjust production processes, acquire resources, or enter/exit the market.\nThe Ease and Cost of Factor Substitution: The easier and less costly it is to switch production factors (like labour and machinery) between different uses, the more elastic the supply will be, as producers can adapt quickly to changes in market conditions.\n\n\n\nSignificance of price elasticity of supply for decision makers\n\nCreating spare capacity\nKeeping large volumes of stocks (inventories)\nImproving storage systems to prolong the shelf-life of products\nAdopting or upgrading to the latest technology\nImproving distribution systems (how the products get to the customers)\nDeveloping and training employees to improve labour occupational mobility (to perform a range of jobs)\n\n\n\nChapter 13: Market economic system\n\nEconomic system - The way in which an economy is organised and run including alternative views of how scarce resources are best allocated.\nEconomic agents - Households and firms\nMain types of economic systems:\n\nPlanned economy\n\nRelies on the government (in the public sector) allocating resources.\nExamples: North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba\n\n\nMixed economy\n\nCombination of market and planned economy\nSome resources owned and controlled by private individuals and firms, others owned and controlled by the government.\n\nExamples: Japan, Italy, Spain\n\n\n\n\nMarket economy\n\nRelies on the market forces of demand and supply (in the private sector) to allocate resources with minimal government intervention.\nExamples: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand\nAdvantages\n\nEfficiency\nFreedom of choice\nIncentives\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIncome and wealth inequalities\nEnvironmental issues\nSocial hardship\nWasteful competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14: Market Failure\n\nMarket Failure -

Negative side effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties for which no compensation is paid\n\nExamples:\n\nAir pollution caused by fumes from a factory\nNoise pollution from a nightclub\nCigarette smoke\n\n\n\n\nSocial costs - Total costs of consumption or production to society as a whole\n\nSocial costs = Private costs + External costs\n\n\nPrivate benefits - Benefits of production and consumption enjoyed by a firm, individual, or government\nExternal benefits - Positive side effects of production or consumption experienced by third parties for which no money is paid by the beneficiary.\nSocial benefits - Total benefits of consumption or production to society as a whole\n\nSocial benefits = Private benefits + External benefits\n\n\nCauses and consequences of market failure:\n\nPublic goods - Goods that the private sector fails to provide due to a lack of profit motive.\n\nExamples:\n\nStreet lighting\nRoad signs\nLaw and order\nNational defence\nLighthouses\nPublic roads\n\n\nNon-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption. (It isn’t possible to exclude non-payers from the product and there is no competition to purchase or use the product)\n\n\nMerit goods - Goods that have social benefits but are under-provided and under-consumed without government intervention or provision.\n\nExamples:\n\nEducation\nHealthcare services\nVaccinations\n\n\nThey create positive spill over effects for third parties\n\n\nDemerit goods - Goods that have social costs when consumed or produced but are over-produced and over-consumed without government intervention\n\nExamples:\n\nCigarettes\nAlcohol\nRecreational drugs\nGambling\n\n\n\n\nAbuse of monopoly power - Profit-maximising monopolists lack incentives to be competitive, so create inefficiencies in the market (For more detail see chapter 23)\nFactor Immobility - When it is difficult for factors of production to be moved between different uses or locations.\n\nGeographical immobility\nOccupational immobility\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15: Mixed economic system\n\nMixed economic system - Combination between planned and market economies.\n\nThe degree of public and private sector involvement in economic activities is determined by the government.\n\n\nMaximum prices - Method of price control where the government sets the maximum price of a product below the market equilibrium price\n\nMakes products more affordable and encourages consumption.\nCreates excess demand\n\n\nMinimum prices - Government sets the minimum price of a product above the market equilibrium price\n\nCreates incentive to supply more\nCreates excess supply\n\n\nMethods to correct market failures:\n\nIndirect taxation - Imposing taxes on specific products (usually demerit goods) to reduce demand\nSubsidies - Government financial assistance to reduce prices and increase demand\nRules and regulations\nEducation - Mandate that schools teach students about the negative side effects of demerit goods\nPrivatisation - The transfer of the ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector\nNationalisation - Purchase of private sector assets by the government\nDirect provision - Providing certain goods and services free of charge to citizens\n\n\n"},"Economics/Notes/Section-3---Microeconomic-decision-makers":{"slug":"Economics/Notes/Section-3---Microeconomic-decision-makers","filePath":"Economics/Notes/Section 3 - Microeconomic decision makers.md","title":"Section 3 - Microeconomic decision makers","links":["Economics/Notes/Section-3---Microeconomic-decision-makers","Economics/Notes/Section-1---The-basic-economic-problem"],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 16 - Money and banking\n\nMoney - Any commodity that can be used as medium of exchange for the purchase of goods or services.\nForms of money:\n\nCash - Banknotes and coins\nBank deposits - Money reserves placed in commercial bank accounts in electronic form\nCentral bank reserves - Money held by the central bank and used by commercial banks to make payments between themselves\n\n\nFunctions of money\n\nMedium of exchange\nMeasure of value / Unit of account\nStore of value\nStandard of deferred payment\n\n\nCharacteristics of money\n\nDurability\nAcceptability\nDivisibility\nUniformity\nScarcity\nPortability\n\n\nBartering - Swapping items in exchange for other items through a process of bargaining and negotiation.\n\nRequires a double coincidence of wants\nNo divisibility or portability\n\n\nCentral banks - The monetary authority that oversee and manage the economy’s money supply and banking system.\n\nKey Functions:\n\nThe sole issuer of banknotes and coins\nThe government’s bank\nThe banker’s bank\nThe lender of last resort\n\n\n\n\nCommercial banks - A retail bank that also provides financial services to its customers.\n\nPrimary Functions:\n\nAccepting deposits\nMaking advances\nCredit creation\n\n\nSecondary Functions:\n\nCollecting and clearing cheques on behalf of their clients\nOffering additional financial services such as tax advice, foreign exchange dealings and the buying and selling of shares.\nProviding safety deposit boxes for customers to safeguard highly valued possessions, including jewellery and important documents such as wills.\nProviding money transfer facilities, such as transferring money to an overseas bank account or to pay various bills, such as telephone, electricity, gas, and water bills.\nOffering credit card facilities for the convenience of customers (private individuals and commercial clients).\nOffering internet banking facilities such as online bill payments, wired bank transfers between bank accounts, and the online purchase of shares and foreign currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17 - Households\n\nSaving - When a person puts away part of their current income for future spending\nBorrowing - When an individual, firm, or the government takes out a loan, paying it back to the lender over a period of time, with interest payments.\nInfluences on household spending:\n\nIncome\n\nCan be earned mainly from wages and salaries (return on labour).

Influenced by:\n\nThe number of full-time and part-time workers in the labour force\nThe age distribution of the workforce\nThe official retirement age of the country\n\n\nAvailability and level of welfare benefits\nChanging social attitudes\nGeographical mobility - The willingness and ability of a person to relocate for work. May decrease due to:\n\nFamily ties and related commitments\nCosts of living\n\n\nOccupational mobility - The extent to which a person is able to change between jobs\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium wage rate - The wage rate where the demand for labour is equal to the supply of labour\nRelative bargaining power - The ability of workers to achieve higher wages depends partly on their ability to negotiate and bargain with their employers. Influenced by:\n\nTrade unions (See chapter 19)\nAge and experience\nLevel of education\n\n\nMinimum wage - Lowest legal amount any firm can pay its workers (set by the government)\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWorkers are not exploited by employers and receive a reasonable wage for an hour’s work\nMore incentive to work for the unemployed\nWorkers earn more money overall and may increase the average consumption in an economy\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nWorkers who earn more than minimum wage may want higher wage rates to maintain the wage difference between them and workers who earn minimum wage. This also causes higher wage bills for firms and demand for labour decreases\nUnemployment in the economy may increase because firms face higher wage bills and demand for labour decreases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for differences in earnings:\n\nSkilled and unskilled workers - Skilled workers mostly earn more than unskilled workers\n\nSkilled workers have higher demand and lower supply while unskilled workers have lower demand and higher supply.\nSkilled workers are more inelastic in supply than unskilled workers\n\n\nPrimary, secondary, and tertiary sector workers\n\nPrimary sector workers tend to earn the least wages in the economy. This is because:\n\nTheir work is usually more unskilled\nThe output of these industries usually has a low sales value\n\n\nSecondary and tertiary sector professions tend to have higher earnings. This is because:\n\nTheir work usually requires a higher level of education and experience\n\n\n\n\nMale and female workers\n\nIn all countries, there is a noticeable difference between the average wages of male and female workers. This is because:\n\nMore women work in part-time jobs than men, so earning are lower on average\nWomen may take career breaks to have children and therefore miss out on promotional opportunities\nWomen may accept low-paid and part-time jobs where hours are flexible in order to allow childcare arrangements\nWomen may face discrimination at work\n\n\n\n\nPrivate and public sector workers\n\nTypically, workers in the public sector earn more than workers in the private sector. This is because:\n\nThe main goal of private individuals and firms is profit maximisation\n\n\nPrivate sector jobs are usually less secure and aren’t accompanied by a pension in retirement.\n\n\n\n\nDivision of labour and specialisation of labour\n\nSpecialisation of labour - Workers being expert in a particular profession\nDivision of labour - Workers being expert in a particular production process.\nAdvantages:\n\nProductivity and efficiency increases\nQuality of the product or service increases\nEarning potential may increase as the workers are more skilful\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nWork may become repetitive and boring\nWorkers may become alienated\nThe production process may become overspecialised\nThe workers may become deskilled in other areas\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19 - Trade Unions\n\nTrade union / Labour union - Organisation that aims to protect the interests of its worker members\n\nWorkers pay a subscription fee (usual annual) to become members\nEmployers and employees have different aims and objectives:\n\nEmployers may want to:\n\nMaximise profits\nMinimise costs\nMaximise sales\n\n\nEmployees may want to:\n\nMaximise wages/salaries\nWork in a safe and healthy environment\nHave good terms and conditions at work\nMaximise their non-wage benefits\nHave job security at work\n\n\nThere is usually a conflict between the aims of employers and employees.\n\n\nTypes of trade unions\n\nCraft unions - Organised by skill/craft\nIndustrial unions - Organised by industry\nWhite collar unions - Recruit professional, administrative, and clerical staff (salaried workers) and other non-manual workers\nGeneral unions - They accept anyone and therefore usually have a large membership of unskilled workers.\n\n\nRole of trade unions in the economy\n\nPrimary role - Protect the interests of its members\nOther roles:\n\nBargaining with employers for pay rises and better terms and conditions\nEnsuring equipment at work is safe to use (supported by health and safety legislation) and that workers are given sufficient training to enable them to perform their role at work safely\nEnsuring members are given legal advice when necessary\nGiving support to members when they are made redundant\nProviding financial and legal support to workers who may have been unfairly dismissed or disciplined\nPersuading the government to pass legislation in favour of workers, such as legislation covering minimum wages, maximum working hours, pension rights and the retirement age.\n\n\nCollective bargaining - Process of trade union representatives negotiating on behalf of their worker members with employer representatives for better pay and conditions.\nClaims for higher wages is usually based on one of these factors:\n\nA rise in the cost of living due to inflation\nWorkers in comparable occupations who have received a wage increase\nIncreased profits of the firm and industry as a whole\nAn increase in the productivity of labour\n\n\nIndustrial action - Measures taken by trade union members as a result of major disagreements or disputes with their employers.\n\nTypes of industrial action:\n\nStrike - Trade union members refuse to work\nWork-to-rule - Trade union members work to fulfil the minimum requirements of their job, literally, and do not go beyond what is written in their employment contracts\nGo-slow - Trade union members complete their work very slowly\nSit-in - Trade union members turn up to work and occupy the premises but do not undertake their normal work\n\n\n\n\nFactors affecting the strength of trade unions - Mainly the number of members and the degree of the their unity\n\nPossible reasons for an increase in the number of members:\n\nGrowth in manufacturing jobs (The manufacturing industry is often unionised as workers typically receive low pay and have poor working conditions)\nA widening wealth gap and higher costs of living\n\n\nPossible reasons for a decrease in the number of members:\n\nGovernment legislation to reduce trade union influence\nDecline in manufacturing jobs\nGrowth in part-time employment (Part-time workers are less likely to join a trade union)\nA growing number of firms independently agreeing to fairer terms and conditions of employment\nIncrease in unemployment\nIncrease in employment in small firms (It is more difficult to organise trade unions within such organisations)\nIncrease in the number of self-employed people (people who work for themselves and not for a firm), and who therefore cannot be trade union members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of trade unions for an economy\n\nDisputes between employers and employees are usually solved harmoniously and efficiently\nThey cause overall productivity to increase (as workers end up having better pay and working conditions)\nThey negotiate with the government to introduce or increase the minimum wage (increasing the standards of living in the economy)\nThey reduce conflicts creating higher motivation in the workforce\nThey offer legal support and advice to workers who may have lost their jobs or be facing the threat of redundancies (job losses)\n\n\nDisadvantages of trade unions for an economy\n\nStrikes can cause serious disruption to firms and the wider economy\nTrade union demands for better pay and conditions may increase firm production costs and therefor reduce profits\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20 - Firms\n\nClassification of firms\n\nEconomic sector\n\nPrimary sector - Firms that extract raw materials from the earth\nSecondary sector - Firms that manufacture goods, or construct buildings, roads, and bridges\nTertiary sector - Firms that provide services to the general public and other firms.\nFirms cannot operate without using goods and services from all three sectors of industry to make and sell its goods or services to the final customer. This is called Interdependence\n\n\nPublic and private sectors\n\nPrivate sector - Owned by private individuals and owners\n\nMain aim is to own profit\nTypes:\n\nSole trader (or sole proprietor) - Owned and controlled by a single person\nPartnership - Owned by 2 to 20 people with share ownership and risk-taking\nPrivate limited company - Owned by shareholders who are unable to buy or sell shares without the consent of other shareholders\nPublic limited company - Owned by shareholders who can openly and freely buy or sell shares on a stock exchange\n\n\n\n\nPublic sector - Owned by the government\n\nMain aim is to provide a service to the general public\n\n\n\n\nRelative size\n\nMethods to measure relative size of a firms:\n\nNumber of employees\nMarket share - The firm’s sales revenues as a proportion of the industry’s sales revenue.\nMarket capitalisation of a firm - Stock market value of a company (Total number of shares multiplied by the current share price)\nSales revenue of a firm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall firms\n\nReasons small firms co-exist with large firms:\n\nThey may be competing with supermarkets by offering unique items like specialty cheeses and wines.\nThey may be the only local seller in remote areas.\nOffering more personal shopping experiences compared to a self-service style experience at large supermarkets.\nQuick adaption to consumer taste changes\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\nLesser legal formalities and start up costs are lower\n(For sole traders) The owner receives all of the profits made (So there is an incentive to work hard)\n(For sole traders) They don’t have to take orders from others, they have flexibility in decision making, and have higher self-esteem from being successful.\nLikely to know customers better (and on a personal level)\nEasier to manage and control; unaffected by diseconomies of scale (see ahead for more detail)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLimited start up capital\nLarge risk of business failure\nSuccess depends almost completely on the abilities and commitment of the owners.\nSuffer from lack of continuity (Owner may go on holiday or become sick)\nUnable to exploit economies of scale (see ahead for more detail)\n\n\n\n\nTypes of growth of firms\n\nInternal growth / Organic growth - Expansion using the firm’s own resources\nExternal growth / Inorganic growth - Expansion involving another organisation, such as through one of the following:\n\nTakeover - A firm is taken over by another firm\nFranchise - An individual or firm purchases the licence from another firm to trade using the name of the parent company\nMerger - Two or more firms join together to form one firm\n\nHorizontal merger - Two or more firms from the same economic sector of industry join together\n\nBenefits:\n\nHaving higher market share\nGaining skilled employees from each other\nOperating with fewer employees (for example, there is no need to hire two finance departments)\nTaking advantage of economies of scale\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nDuplication of resources causing job losses. Job losses can cause demotivation which may cause a fall in productivity\nThere may be increasing costs arising costs from diseconomies of scale\nNew firm may suffer from culture clashes between the merged businesses\n\n\n\n\nVertical merger - Two or more firms from different economic sectors of industry join together\n\nBackward vertical merger - Occurs when:\n\nA firm from the secondary sector merges with a firm from the primary sector\nA firm from the tertiary sector merges with a firm from the primary or secondary sector.\nBenefits:\n\nThe firm in the secondary sector has control over the quality of raw materials with which it is supplied\nThe price of raw materials fall as the manufacturer does not have to pay an external firm for the raw materials\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nTotal costs increase as more land, labour and capital resources may be required for a firm in the primary sector\nTransport costs increase for the merged firm as raw materials were previously delivered by external suppliers\n\n\n\n\nForward vertical merger - Occurs when:\n\nA firm from the secondary sector merges with a firm from the tertiary sector\nA firm from the primary sector merges with a firm from the secondary or tertiary sector.\n\n\n\n\nConglomerate merger - Two or more firms from unrelated areas of business join together to create a new firm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomies and diseconomies of scale\n\nEconomics of scale - Cost-saving benefits of large-scale operations, which reduce average costs of production\n\nInternal economies of scale - Cost savings that arise from within the business as it grows\n\nPurchasing (bulk-buying) economies of scale - When the cost of raw materials falls when they are bought in large quantities\nTechnical economies of scale - When large firms purchase expensive pieces of machinery and automated equipment for the production process\nFinancial economies of scale - When firms are able to borrow money from banks more easily because they are perceived by financial institutions to be more risky. Large firms also have greater values of assets, which can act as security for loans and mortgages.\nManagerial economies of scale - When firms have the resources to employ specialist managers to undertake functions within a firm\nRisk-bearing economies of scale - When firms produce a range of products and operate in many locations. This diversity spreads risks\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) economies of scale - When firms are able to fund R&amp;D and can therefore be innovative\nMarketing economies of scale - When firms have large advertising budgets, so can spend large amounts of money promoting their products\n\n\nExternal economies of scale - Economies of scale that arise from factors outside the firm\n\nProximity to related firms\nAvailability of skilled labour\nReputation of the geographical area\nAccess to transportation networks\n\n\n\n\nDiseconomies of scale - When a firm gets too large, its average costs of production start to rise as output increases. (The disadvantages of growth start to outweigh the advantages)\n\nCauses of diseconomies of scale:\n\nCommunication issues\nUnsuccessful merger due to a clash of cultures\n\nIn some cases, it may be beneficial to demerge (When two previously merged firms decide to break up and become two separate firms again)\n\n\nRequirement for more employees or a new factory to accommodate the increased level of production.\nLose of motivation due to workers not feeling part of a large firm (lack of importance/contribution)\nOperating in areas with less expertise causing costs to increase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 21 - Firms and production\n\nFactors of production (See chapter 2 for details)\n\nLand - Natural resources\nLabour - Physical and mental human input\nCapital - Manufactured goods\nEnterprise - The ideas (and the people who have them) to combine the other three factors of production in pursuit of profit\n\n\nDerived demand - Where a factor of production isn’t demanded for its own sake, but for the goods and services it is used to produce.\nDemand for factors of production - Depends on:\n\nDerived demand\nCost\nQuantity (or availability)\nProductivity (see ahead for more detail)\n\n\nLabour-intensive and capital-intensive production\n\nLabour-intensive production - When the cost of labour is proportionately higher than the cost of other factors of production\n\nExamples: Accountancy, real estate services, tourism\nAdvantages\n\nSuitable for highly customised products (like tailor-made suits and wedding gowns)\nAllows customers to receive a more personalised experience\nQuality of the product may be higher if workers are skilled\nMore flexible (Temporary workers can be hired during peak trading seasons)\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nCan be very expensive\nSkilled and experience workers result in higher costs of production\n\n\n\n\nCapital-intensive production - When the cost of capital is proportionately higher than the cost of other factors of production\n\nExamples: Car manufacturing, soft drink production, oil extraction\nAdvantages\n\nEasier mass production\nRelatively low unit costs of production\nReduces human error in the production process\nPotential cost savings in the form of technological economies of scale (See chapter 20 for more details)\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nHigher set-up costs (causing a higher barrier to entry - see chapter 23 for more details)\nMore servicing and maintenance costs\nReplacement costs (when equipment becomes outdated or in need of upgrading)\n\n\n\n\nChoosing between capital- and labour-intensive production:\n\nCost of labour compared to cost of capital - Capital-intensive production is better if labour costs are high\nSize of the market - Labour-intensive production is better for smaller markets or for more personalised services. (like a private tutor, or counsellor)\nThe firm’s objectives - Firms will choose based on which will maximise profit for them\n\n\n\n\nProduction - The total output of goods and services in the production process\nProductivity - Measure of the degree of efficiency in the use of the inputs in the production process (Ratio: The value of output compared to the cost of the factors of production)\n\nLabour productivity - Efficiency of the workforce in terms of output per worker\nCapital productivity - Efficiency of the machinery (capital) in terms of output per machine hour\nHigher productivity leads to:\n\nEconomies of scale\nHigher profits\nHigher wages\nImproved competitiveness\nEconomic growth\n\n\nInfluences on productivity\n\nInvestment - Expenditure on physical capital\nInnovation - Commercialisation of new ideas and products\nSkills and experience - The quantity and quality of labour\nEntrepreneurial spirit - Willingness and ability of entrepreneurs to take risks in the pursuit of profit (the quality of enterprise)\nCompetition - Rivalry creates an incentive for firms to be more productive\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22 - Firms’ costs, revenue and objectives\n\nCosts of production - A firm’s expenditure in the process of producing goods and/or providing services\n\nExamples:\n\nWages and salaries paid to employees\nRent paid to land owners\nAdvertising expenses\nPurchases of raw materials and components from suppliers\nUtility bills for telephone, gas, and electricity services\nDividend payments to shareholders\nTaxes paid to the government based on the profits\n\n\nFixed costs (FC) - The costs a firm has to pay irrespective of how much it produces or sells\n\nFixed cost line - Flat (the costs do not change based on the output)\n\n\nVariable costs (VC) - The costs that change as the level of output changes\n\nVariable cost line - Starts at origin and slopes upwards (when there is no output, no variable costs are incurred)\n\n\nTotal cost (TC) - Sum of the all fixed and variable costs of production\n\nTotal cost line - Starts above origin and slopes upwards (when there is no output, fixed costs still need to be paid)\n\n\nAverage fixed costs (AFC) - Fixed cost per unit of output\nAverage variable cost (AVC) - Variable cost per unit of output\nAverage total cost (ATC) - Total cost per unit of output\n\n\nRevenue - Money payable to a firm from the sale of its goods and services\n\nTotal revenue (TR) - Aggregate amount of money a firm receives from selling goods and services\n\n\\text{total revenue} = \\text{price} \\times \\text{quantity sold}\n\n\nAverage revenue (AR) - Typical price received from a sale of a good or service\n\n\\text{average revenue} = \\text{total revenue} \\div \\text{quantity sold}\n\n\n\n\nObjectives of firms\n\nSurvival\nSocial welfare\nGrowth\nProfit maximisation\n\n\nProfit - Positive difference between a firm’s total revenue and its total cost of production. (Profit = TR - TC)\n\nChapter 23 - Market structure\n\nMarket structure - Refers to the key characteristics of a particular market\n\nThese include:\n\nThe number and size of firms in the market\nThe degree and intensity of price and non-price competition\nThe nature of barriers to entry (Obstacles that prevent firms from entering a market)\n\n\nThe two extreme market structures are competitive markets and monopoly markets\n\n\nCompetitive market - Market structure with an immense degree of competition\n\nMany firms in the industry (all without very significant market power)\nThe large number of firms impacts:\n\nPrice:\n\nFirms in competitive markets are price takers (Firms that set their price according to the market price, rather than determining their own prices)\nPrices are determined by market forces of demand and supply, not by the firms themselves\n\n\nQuality:\n\nIn highly competitive markets, firms often produce homogeneous products (e.g., bananas, strawberries)\nLittle focus on quality as a form of product differentiation\n\n\nChoice:\n\nFirms may focus on differentiated products using branding, design, colour, and quality\nSuccessful firms use slogans to improve competitiveness\n\n\nProfit:\n\nBuyers and sellers have easy access to product and price information\nMany rivals in the industry lead to relatively low profits for each firm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonopoly markets - Market structure where there is only one main supplier of a good or service\n\nPure monopoly - When only one firm supplies the whole market.\nThese firms are price makers / price setters (Firms that set their own price as they have the market power to do so)\nCharacteristics:\n\nSingle supplier - A monopolist is the sole supplier of a product in the market\nPrice maker - The monopolist has significant market power and controls enough of the market supply to be able to charge higher prices\nImperfect knowledge - A monopolist is able to protect its position as customers and rivals have imperfect knowledge, partly as a result of the monopolist’s ability to protect its trade secrets\nHigh barriers to entry - The monopolist can only remain so if in the long run there are very high barriers to entry\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nLarge economics of scale\nAbility to invest in innovation\nEliminating wasteful competition\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nInefficient in resource allocation\nDemand becomes price inelastic due to a lack of substitutes\nMonopolists can charge unnecessarily high prices due to high barriers of entry\nImperfect knowledge means customers may not necessarily make rational choices\nLess incentive to innovate due to lack of competition\n\n\n\n\n"},"Economics/Notes/Section-4---Government-and-the-macro-economy":{"slug":"Economics/Notes/Section-4---Government-and-the-macro-economy","filePath":"Economics/Notes/Section 4 -

The role of the government\n\nThe general role of the government is to improve the general welfare of its people.\nThe government collects tax revenues in order to fund its expenditure\nThe government operates three roles:\n\nLocal role - Provides public and merit goods\n\nRubbish collection\nStreet lighting\nBuilding libraries, schools, hospitals, and public parks\n\n\nNational role - Makes decisions about how to achieve the macroeconomic roles (See |chapter 25 for more details) using appropriate policies like:\n\nFiscal Policy:\n\nGovernment decisions on raising money through taxation and other sources.\nAllocation of the annual budget on welfare, education, healthcare, defence, etc.\n\n\nMonetary Policy:\n\nCentral bank or monetary authority decisions on interest rates and money supply.\nAims to influence economic activity.\n\n\nSupply-Side Policies:\n\nAdjustments to minimum wage levels.\nCreation of bodies like a Competition Commission to regulate firm behaviour.\nFocused on promoting economic growth by increasing productive capacity.\n\n\nPolicies to Protect the Environment:\n\nIncludes international agreements like the Paris Agreement.\nAim to address environmental issues and promote sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nInternational role\n\nManages international trade\nTrading bloc - Free trade area which also promotes the free movement of factors of production between member countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25 - The macroeconomic aims of government\n\nGovernments have 5 main macroeconomic aims:\nEconomic Growth\n\nDefinition\n\nAnnual increase in the level of national output\nAnnual percentage change in GDP (Gross domestic product)\nRepresentation of a long-term expansion in the production capacity of the economy\nOutward shift of the production possibility curve (see chapter 4 for more details)\n\n\nMost practical measure of standards of living\n\n\nFull employment / Low unemployment\n\nUnemployment - When a person is:\n\nWilling and able to work\nActively seeking employment\nUnable to find work\n\n\nHigh employment leads to economic growth\nUnemployment rate: \\frac{N}{T}\\times100 where N is the number of unemployed people and T is the total number of people in the workforce (included employed and unemployed people)\n\n\nStable prices / Low inflation\n\nInflation - Sustained rise in the general price level in an economy\nPrice of every good or service doesn’t rise, rather, average prices rise\nUsually, governments set a target rate in order to control economic activity\nNot completely bad because higher prices can encourage firms to supply more output\n\n\nBalance of payments stability\n\nBalance of payments - A financial record of a country’s transactions with the rest of the world during a single year.\n\nIncludes country’s trade in goods and services with other countries.\nCredit items - Payment received from other countries\nDebit items - Payment made to other countries\n\n\nIn theory, the balance of payments should balance over time because, a country, like an individual, can only spend what it earns.\nBalance of payments deficit - Country is uncompetitive in international markets\nBalance of payments surplus - Country is overcompetitive in international markets\n\n\nRedistribution of income\n\nAchieving greater equality in the distribution of income in an economy\nEconomies face unequitable distribution of income due to the naturally unequal ownership of factors of production in a free market economy\nTaxation is used to redistribute income\n\nProgressive taxation - A type of taxation that charges higher percentage tax as an individual’s income rises\n\n\nOther ways to redistribute income are:\n\nSubsidies\nWelfare benefits\n\n\n\n\nConflicts between aims\n\nUsually impossible to achieve all five goals at once\nGovernments may be left with a trade off\nThe government has to decide which aim is the most important to the economy at a particular time\nPotentials conflicts:\n\nFull employment versus stable prices\n\nWhen more people are earning more money, firms may raise their prices more causing demand-pull inflation.\nWhen more people are employed, firms find it harder to attract skilled labour, leading to wage inflation (Cost-push inflation)\n\n\nEconomic growth versus balance of payments stability\n\nIf economic growth is cause by higher consumption expenditure, it may cause a deficit in the country’s balance of payments\n\n\nFull employment versus balance of payments stability\n\nAs employment rises, people get wealthier and spend more money on imports causing a deficit in the balance of payments\n\n\nEconomic growth versus stable prices\n\nA cut interest rates or an increase in the money supply in order to stimulate economic growth can conflict with inflation causing price instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 26 -

Paid from the income, wealth, or profit of individuals and firms\nIndirect tax - Expenditure tax imposed on spending on goods and services\n\n\nTypes of taxation\n\nProgressive\n\nAs income rises, the rate of tax imposed rises (tax percentage rises)\n\n\nRegressive\n\nAs income rises, the rate of tax imposed falls (tax percentage falls)\nIncludes taxes that are the same amount at any income level (the tax percentage decreases at higher income levels)\n\n\nProportional\n\nRate of tax remains constant at any income level\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of taxation\n\nEquitable (fair) - Taxes should be based on the taxpayer’s ability to pay\nEconomical - Tax should be easy and cheap to collect\nConvenience - The method of payment should be convenient to the taxpayer\nCertainty - The taxpayer should know what, when, where, and how to pay the tax\nEfficiency - The tax system should attempt to achieve its aims without any undesirable side-effects\nFlexibility - Taxes should be flexible enough to adapt to a change in the economic environment\n\n\nClassification of taxes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxDefinitionIncome taxA direct tax levied on personal incomes - wages, interest, rent, and dividends. In most countries, this is the main source of tax revenuesCorporation taxA direct tax on the profits of businessesSales taxAn indirect tax, such as VAT, charged on an individual’s spendingExcise dutiesIndirect inland taxes imposed on certain goods and services such as alcohol, tobacco, petrol, soft drinks and gamblingCustoms dutiesIndirect cross-border taxes on foreign importsCapital gains taxA direct tax on the earnings made from investments such as buying shares and private propertyInheritance taxA direct tax on the transfer of income and wealth such as property when passed on to another personStamp dutyA progressive tax paid on the sale of commercial or residential propertyCarbon taxA tax imposed on vehicle manufacturers or firms that produce excessivecarbon emissionsWindfall taxA tax charged on individuals and firms that gain an unexpected one-offamount of money, such as a person winning the lottery or a firm gainingfrom a takeover bid\n\nFiscal Policy - The use of taxation and government expenditure to influence the level of economic activity and achieve macroeconomic goals\n\nTaxes can be used to redistribute income and wealth, benefiting less wealthy members of society.\nGovernment spending improves living standards, like building infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads, etc.).\n\n\nFiscal Policy Measures\n\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy:\n\nIncreases government spending and/or lowers taxes to stimulate the economy.\nUsed to reduce the effects of economic recessions by boosting consumption and investment, reducing unemployment.\nExample: Increase in social security payments or lowering of income taxes.\n\n\nContractionary Fiscal Policy:\n\nReduces the level of economic activity by decreasing government spending or raising taxes.\nAims to reduce inflationary pressures during economic booms.\nExample: Property taxes used to slow down house prices during a housing bubble.\n\n\n\n\nEffects of Fiscal Policy on Macroeconomic Aims:\n\nEconomic Growth:\n\nCapital expenditure on infrastructure boosts investment.\nLower corporate tax rates attract foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\n\nStable Prices / Low Inflation:\n\nLower taxes and increased productivity keep price levels low.\nContractionary measures prevent price levels from soaring.\nEmployment:\n\nCuts in income tax incentivize people to seek jobs.\nGovernment support for startups can lower unemployment.\n\n\nBalance of Payments Stability:\n\nLow tax rates help domestic firms remain competitive, aiding exports.\nSubsidizing industries also improves international competitiveness.\n\n\nRedistribution of Income:\n\nProgressive taxes and government spending (welfare, education, healthcare) redistribute income effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 27 - Monetary policy\n\nDefinition of Monetary Policy\n\nThe manipulation of interest rates, exchange rates, and the money supply to control the level of spending and investment in the economy.\nUsed to affect macroeconomic objectives such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.\nThe central bank typically oversees these policies.\n\n\nMonetary Policy Measures:\n\nChanges in Interest Rates:\n\nThe primary tool to control economic activity.\nHigher rates discourage borrowing and encourage saving, reducing overall spending.\nLower rates encourage borrowing and spending, boosting economic activity.\n\n\nChanges in the Money Supply:\n\nIncreasing or decreasing the money supply affects consumption and investment.\nFor example, allowing banks to lend more stimulates economic growth.\n\n\nChanges in Exchange Rates:\n\nExchange rates impact the domestic money supply as purchasing foreign goods requires converting currencies.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Monetary Policy:\n\nExpansionary (Loose) Monetary Policy:\n\nLowers interest rates to boost economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and increasing disposable income.\nEncourages households and firms to spend and invest more.\n\n\nContractionary (Tight) Monetary Policy:\n\nIncreases interest rates to reduce inflation by curbing excessive spending.\nCan reduce economic growth and employment in the long term.\n\n\n\n\nEffects of Monetary Policy on Macroeconomic Aims:\n\nEconomic Growth:\n\nLower interest rates decrease borrowing costs, encouraging consumption and investment.\nLess saving leads to higher demand and growth.\n\n\nFull Employment / Low Unemployment:\n\nEconomic growth from lower interest rates tends to create more jobs.\n\n\nStable Prices / Low Inflation:\n\nHigher interest rates control inflation by reducing demand, while lower rates boost economic output without driving up prices.\n\n\nBalance of Payments Stability:\n\nA lower exchange rate improves international competitiveness, boosting exports.\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Monetary Policy:\n\nThere can be time lags before interest rate changes take effect, making the outcome uncertain.\nConsumer and business confidence also play a role in economic activity, so monetary policy alone might not be sufficient.\nHigher interest rates can deter foreign investment and reduce production capacity.\n\n\n\nChapter 28 - Supply-side policy\n\nSupply-side policies - Long-term measures to increase the productive capacity of the economy, leading to an outward shift of the production possibility curve.\n\nSupply-side policies improve the quality and/or quantity of factors of production\nExamples:\n\nEducation and training - Improving education and training results in a workforce with better skills, productivity, flexibility, and mobility.\nLabour market reforms - Reducing or removing: the power of trade unions, unemployment benefits, minimum wages.\nLower direct taxes - Reducing tax on worker income to create more incentive\nDeregulation - Reduction or removal of barriers of entry.\nImproving incentives to work - Reducing taxes on worker income, reducing unemployment benefits, etc.\nImproving incentives to invest - Using tax incentives and subsidies encourage firms to invest.\nPrivatisation - Selling government assets (like properties and businesses) to private individuals and firms to be run more efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nEffects on macroeconomic aims\n\nEconomic growth - Supply-side policies, like investment in education and corporate tax cuts, increase the economy’s productive capacity, fostering long-term growth.\nFull employment/Low unemployment - Increasing productive capacity creates jobs, while policies like training reduce frictional and structural unemployment.\nStable prices/Low inflation - Supply-side measures boost productivity, preventing excessive price rises and avoiding demand-pull inflation caused by demand-side policies.\nBalance of payments stability - Higher productivity enhances international competitiveness, increasing export earnings and improving the balance of payments.\nRedistribution of income - Policies such as education investment and lower basic income tax rates benefit low-income earners, increasing their disposable income and spending potential.\n\n\n\nChapter 29 - Economic growth\n\nDefinition of economic growth\n\nAnnual increase in the level of national output\nAnnual percentage change in GDP\n\n\nGDP (Gross domestic product) (Also called nominal GDP) - A measure of the monetary value of goods and services produced within a country for a given period of time, usually one year.\n\nFormula:\n\nGDP=C+I+G+(X-M)\nC=\\text{Consumption expenditure}\n\nTotal private household consumption in the country\n\n\nI=\\text{Investment expenditure}\nG=\\text{Government spending}\nX=\\text{Export earnings}\nM=\\text{Import expenditure}\n\n\nReal GDP - Nominal GDP adjusted for inflation\nGDP per head (or GDP per capita) - The GDP of a country divided by its population\n\n\nBusiness cycle (or trade cycle) - Describes the fluctuations in the economic activity of a country over time, creating a long-term trend of economic growth in the economy\n\nShown on a graph (GDP / time)\nTrend - The trend line shows the overall change in GDP over time\nPeak - GDP is at its highest level\n\nUnemployment is low\nConsumer and business confidence are high\n\n\nRecession - GDP falls for two consecutive quarters (6 months)\n\nDecline in consumption, investment, and net exports\nCauses:\n\nHigher level of unemployment\nHigher interest rates (discourages investment, encourages saving)\nGreater uncertainty in the economy\nLower rates of disposable income (fall in consumer spending)\nLower levels of government expenditure\nDecline in the demand for exports\nLower levels of consumer and business confidence\n\n\n\n\nSlump (or trough) - Lowest point of a recession\n\nHigh unemployment\nLow consumption, investment, and net export earnings\n\n\nRecovery - GDP starts to rise after a slump\n\nRising consumption, investment, and net export earnings\nLeads to employment opportunities in the long run\n\n\nBoom - GDP rises for two consecutive quarters (6 months)\n\nLevel of economic activity rises\nCaused by any combination of an increase in consumption, investment, government spending, and net export earnings.\n\n\n\n\nEconomic growth\n\nCauses:\n\nFactor endowments (Quality and quantity of factors of production0\nLabour force (Size, skills, and mobility of the workforce)\nLabour productivity\nInvestment expenditure\n\n\nPositive consequences:\n\nImproved standards of living\nHigher levels of employment\nTax revenues\n\n\nNegative consequences:\n\nEnvironmental consequences\nRisk of inflation\nInequalities in income and wealth\nResource repletion\n\n\nPolicies to increase economic growth:\n\nFiscal policy (see chapter 26)\nMonetary policy (see chapter 27)\nSupply-side policies (see chapter 28)\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 30 - Employment and unemployment\n\nEmployment - The use of factors of production in the economy (usually labour)\nFull employment/Low unemployment as a macroeconomic aim (see chapter 25):\n\nRaises standards of living for the average person\nPromotes economic growth\nIncreases tax revenues\nWelfare benefits are decreased\nPrevents brain drain (when highly skilled workers leave the country in search of job opportunities elsewhere)\nReduces income and wealth inequalities\n\n\nUnemployment - Occurs when people of working age are both willing and able to work but cannot find employment\nFull employment - Everyone in an economy who is willing and able to work has a job\nEmployment patterns (as the economy develops):\n\nEmployment sector - Primary sector workforce decreases overall and tertiary sector workforce increases\nDelayed entry to the workforce - More people spend more time studying for tertiary sector jobs and the average age of employees entering the workforce rises\nAgeing population - The average age of the population increases (due to longer life expectancy and lower birth rates) so firms are forced to hire more older employees\nFormal sector employment - More workers shift from informal employment to formal employment\n\nFormal employment - Workers pay income tax and contribute to the economy’s GDP\n\n\nFemale participation rates - More women are active in the labour force\nPublic sector employment - Decline in worker force in the public sector\nFlexible working patterns - Firms offer more flexible working patterns (like working from home, part-time jobs, and flexible working hours)\n\n\nMeasuring unemployment\n\nTwo methods:\n\nClaimant count - Counts the number of people receiving unemployment benefits\n\nPeople can only claim unemployment benefits if they can prove that they are actively looking for full-time employment\n\n\nLabour force survey (LFS) - Uses the ILO’s standardised household-based survey to collect work-related statistics. (ILO - International labour organisation)\n\nUnemployment measure is based on people who are:\n\nWilling to work, but unable to find employment\nActively seeking work (i.e. they have looked for a job in the last 4 weeks)\nAble to start work within the next 2 weeks\nGoing to start a new job within the next 2 weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rate - Measure of the percentage of a country’s workforce that is out of employment.\n\nFormula\n\n\\dfrac{\\text{Number of unemployed people}}{\\text{Total workforce}}\\times100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of unemployment:\n\nFrictional unemployment - Transitional unemployment which occurs when people change jobs or are in-between jobs\nStructural unemployment - The demand for products produced in a particular industry continually falls, causing firms to downscale and fire employees\n\nUsually due to foreign competition\n\n\nCyclic unemployment (or demand-deficient unemployment) - Unemployment caused by a lack of demand\n\nCauses a fall in national income\nMost severe type of unemployment as it can affect every industry in the economy\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of unemployment:\n\nUnemployed individuals may suffer from mental-health disorders, other health problems, and in extreme cases homelessness and possibly suicide\nThe family and friends of unemployed individuals may have to pay for their expenses leading to lower disposable income and possible disagreements\nMass unemployment could lead to poverty, falling house prices (hence asset values), and increased crime rates\nLower levels of consumer spending, investment, and firm profits, possibly leading to business failures and bankruptcy\nThe government has to pay more overall for welfare benefits\nA higher proportion of taxpayer money is used for welfare benefits and so the government faces an opportunity cost\nThe economy is less internationally competitive\n\n\nPolicies to reduce unemployment:\n\nFiscal policy (see chapter 26)\nMonetary policy (see chapter 27)\nProtectionist measures (see chapter 38)\nSupply-side policies (see chapter 28)\n\nExamples:\n\nInvestment in education and training\nReduction in trade union powers\nIncentives for firms to train and hire more employees\nReducing welfare benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 31 - Inflation and deflation\n\nInflation - The sustained rise in the general level of prices of goods and services over time\n\nAverage price level rises\nReduces the value of money\nReduces the spending power of individuals\nHyperinflation - Very high rates of inflation that are out of control, causing average prices in the economy to rise very rapidly\n\n\nDeflation - The sustained fall in the general price level in an economy over time (negative inflation rate)\n\nBenign deflation (or non-threatening deflation) - Deflation caused by higher supply of goods and services\n\nIncreases the productive capacity of the economy\nDrives down the general price level of goods and services\nIncreasing national income\n\n\nMalign deflation (or harmful deflation) - Deflation caused by demand for goods and services falling\n\nOften due to economic recession and/or rising levels of unemployment\n\n\n\n\nConsumer price index (CPI) - Weighted index of consumer prices in the economy over time\n\nUsed to measure the cost of living for an average household and find the inflation rate\nMeasures price changes of a representative basket of goods and services (consumed by an average household)\nApplies statistical weights to each item to include the relative importance of the average household’s expenditure\n\nBased on the proportion of an average household’s spending on the items in the representative basket of goods and services\n\n\nChanges in the CPI represent changes in the cost of living for the average household in the economy\nUsed for international comparison of inflation rates\nCalculating CPI step-by-step:\n\nDefine the base year - Assign the base year a CPI value of 100. This serves as the benchmark for price comparisons.\nSelect a representative basket - Identify goods and services that reflect typical household spending patterns.\nCollect price data - Gather monthly prices for the items in the basket.\nCalculate the price index - Divide the current basket price by the base year basket price, then multiply by 100 to obtain the CPI.\nApply statistical weights - Assign weights to each item in the basket to reflect its importance in household spending. Multiply each item’s price index by its weight.\nCalculate the weighted CPI - Sum the weighted indices of all items to obtain the overall CPI.\nDetermine the inflation rate - Calculate the percentage change in the CPI over a given time period to measure inflation.\n\n\n\n\nCauses of inflation and deflation:\n\nCost-push inflation - Inflation caused by higher costs of production, thus increasing the general price level\nDemand-pull inflation - Inflation caused by higher levels of demand in the economy, thus increasing the general price level\nImported inflation - Inflation caused by higher import prices, increasing costs of production and thus causing domestic inflation.\nIncreases in the money supply or easier access to credit (such as loans and credit cards)\n\n\nConsequences of inflation:\n\nMenu costs - Catalogues, price lists, and menus need to updated to reflect price changes\nConsumers - The purchasing power of consumers goes down due to the lower value of money\nShoe leather costs - Customers waste time and energy looking for better deals to save money\nSavers - Interest received when saving money, if unchanged, decreases due to inflation\nLenders - Money lent out to borrowers decreases in value when returns\nBorrowers - Value of the money returned is less than the value of the money borrowed\nFixed income earners - Fixed income decreased in value due to inflation (i.e. the real income falls)\nLow income earners - Are affected severely by inflation due to them having a high price elasticity of demand\nExporters - The international competitiveness of an economy tends to fall due to domestic inflation\nImporters - Imports are more expensive due to the lower purchasing power of money\nEmployees - Workers are likely to demand higher wages due to the decreasing value of money\n\nWage-price spiral - Trade unions negotiate higher wages to keep income in line with inflation, inadvertently causing more inflation\n\n\nEmployers - The value of money is uncertain and return on investment is lower (due to higher costs of production)\n\n\nConsequences of deflation:\n\nUnemployment - Deflation reduces demand for goods and services, leading to job losses\nBankruptcies - Deflation lowers sales and profits, causing many firms to go bankrupt\nWealth Effect - Falling profits during deflation decrease share prices and shareholder wealth\nDebt Effect - Deflation raises the real cost of debts, reducing confidence in consumers and businesses\nGovernment Debt - Economic decline during deflation reduces tax revenue and increases government borrowing needs\nConsumer Confidence - Deflation lowers consumer confidence, delaying purchases and worsening the economy\n\n\nPolicies to control inflation and deflation:\n\nFiscal policy (see chapter 26)\nMonetary policy (see chapter 27)\nSupply-side policies (see chapter 28)\n\n\n"},"Economics/Notes/Section-5---Economic-development":{"slug":"Economics/Notes/Section-5---Economic-development","filePath":"Economics/Notes/Section 5 - Economic

living - Social and economic wellbeing of individuals in a country at a particular point in time\nTwo main measures:\n\nGDP per capita (or person)\n\nRelatively easy to calculate\nHigher GDP means more money for people to spend on products\nUses real GDP (see chapter 29) so that inflation is taken into account\nReal GDP doesn’t take into account population size (Example: China will have a higher GDP than Luxembourg simply because it has a higher population)\nGDP per capita is real GDP divided by the population\n\n\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\n\nIncorporates three dimensions:\n\nHealthcare - Measures life expectancy\nEducation - Measures mean years of schooling\nIncome levels - Measures GDP\n\n\nComposite index (Uses several indicators)\nDisadvantages:\n\nIgnores qualitative factors (like gender inequality and human rights)\nDoesn’t take into account income distribution\nIgnores environmental issues (like pollution and resource depletion)\nIgnores cultural differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors that affect living living standards:\n\nProductivity levels - Higher skilled and experienced workers earn higher salaries and therefore higher standards of living\nRole of governments - Governments may use taxes to redistribute income\nSize of population - Includes population density and population demographics\nDistribution of national income - Government expenditure doesn’t always improve living standards (for example: miliary spending)\nRegional differences - The average income in different parts of a country varies\nGeneral price level - Inflation usually leads to lower standards of living\nLevel of education - More education usually leads to higher income and therefore higher living standards\nLevel of freedom - Civil liberties, political rights, religious freedom, and economic rights\n\n\n\nChapter 33 - Poverty\n\nPoverty - Condition where a person lacks adequate income and wealth to sustain a basic standard of living\n\nCreates social and economic problems (like bad health, higher death rate, high crime rate, etc)\nTwo types:\n\nAbsolute poverty - Extreme outright poverty\n\nIncome entirely spent on minimal amounts of food, clothing, and shelter\nIncome lower than the income threshold (or poverty line) - Usually $1.25 per day\n\n\nRelative poverty - Lower standard of living in comparison to an average member of society\n\nComparative measure of poverty\nRelative standard of living to the average person in the country\n\n\n\n\nCauses:\n\nUnemployment - Unemployed people have no stable source of income\nLow wages\nIllness - Lower life expectancy usually causes poorer countries\nAge - The dependant population is unable to work or to work as efficiently\nPoor healthcare\nLow literacy rates - Less educated individuals earn less and are more likely to be in poverty\nHigh population growth - Less resources for each individual\nPoor infrastructure - Reduces overall standards of living\nLow foreign direct investment (FDI) - Amount of investment from other countries\nHigh public debt - Government debt makes it harder for them to improve standards of living since they have to repay loans\nReliance on primary sector output - Usually have lower prices and profit margins\nCorruption and instability\n\n\nPolicies to reduce poverty:\n\nPromoting economic growth - Expansionary policies encourage consumer spending and eventually create more jobs\nImproving education - More educated people can get better jobs\nProviding more generous state benefits - Welfare benefits (like unemployment benefit, elderly pensions, and child benefits) to give people more money to sustain themselves\nUsing progressive taxation - Improves the income distribution of the country\nIntroducing (or increasing) a national minimum wage - Increases incentive to work and people can have a steady source of income\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 34 - Population\n\nPopulation - Number of inhabitants in a country\nPopulation growth - Rate of change in the size of a country’s population\n\n\\text{Birth rate} - \\text{Death rate} + \\text{Net migration rate}\nBirth rate - Number of live births per thousand of the population in a year\n\nFertility rate - Average number of births per woman\nReplacement fertility rate - Number of children the average woman must have to maintain a stable population size\n\n\nDeath rate - Number of deaths per thousand of the population in a year\nNet migration rate - The difference between the immigration and emigration rate\n\n\\text{Net migration rate}=\\text{Immigration} - \\text{Emigration}\nIf positive: Net immigration\nIf negative: Net emigration\n\n\nReasons for different rates\n\nBirth rate - Higher birth rate increases population growth\nDeath rate - Higher death rate decreases population growth\nNet migration rate - High net immigration rate increases population growth\n\n\n\n\nPopulation size\n\nOptimum population - Output of goods and services per head is maximised\nUnderpopulation - Too many resources for the population size\nOverpopulation - Too few resources for the population size\n\n\nPopulation distribution - The composition and structure of a country’s population\n\nDemographics - The study of population distribution and trends in the composition of a population\nTypes:\n\nGender distribution - Ratio of males to females in the population\nAge distribution - Number of people in different age groups\nDependency ratio - Ratio between the number of people not in the labour force to the number of people in active paid employment\n\n\\text{Dependency ratio}=\\dfrac{\\text{Dependent population}}{\\text{Working population}}\nDependent population - Ages 0-14 and 65+\n\nAlso includes full-time students and unemployed people\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging size and structure of the population impact:\n\nConsumers - Demand for specific products vary based on population trends\nFirms - Demand and supply of labour changes long-term\nThe government - Could earn more tax revenue or be pressured to pay more welfare benefits\nThe economy - More pressure on scarce resources possibly leading to higher imports\nThe natural environment - Non-renewable resources are depleted and more infrastructure is required for larger populations\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 35 - Differences in economic development between countries\n\nEconomic development - The increase in the standard of living within a country\n\nConsiders both quantitative and qualitative variables\nFactors affecting economic

36 - International specialisation\n\nSpecialisation - When individuals, firms, regions, or countries concentrate on the production of a particular good or service\n\nInternational specialisation - Countries specialising in a product due to cost advantages (like an abundance of resources)\nAdvantages\n\nEfficiency gains - Scarce resources are used\nLabour productivity - Workers can focus on their skills\nIncreased productive capacity - The PPC moves outward in the direction of the good being specialised in\nEconomies of scale - Firms can enjoy cost savings from large-scale operations (see chapter 20)\nImproved competitiveness - Local industries can compete with international economies\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nOverspecialisation - If the product cannot be produced or demand suddenly falls, it can severely harm the economy\nLack of variety for consumers - Specialisation may lead to standardised, mass-produced goods\nHigh labour turnover - Workers may regularly leave the country in search of more challenging jobs\nLow labour mobility - Workers may find it difficult to switch jobs due to all the retraining required\nHigher labour costs - Specialised workers usually demand higher salaries from firms\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 37 - Globalisation, free trade, and protection\n\nGlobalisation - The process by which the world’s economies become increasingly interdependent and interconnected\n\nPositives:\n\nIncreased international trade creates wealth and jobs worldwide\nFreer movement of labour, capital, goods, and services\nGreater economies of scale\nGreater choice of goods and services for consumers\nMore cultural understanding\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nGreater dependence on the global economy (one problem can cause a chain reaction)\nWidened income and wealth gaps between poorest and richest countries\n\n\n\n\nMultinational corporation (MNC) - Organisation that operates in two or more countries\n\nAdvantages:\n\nJob creation - MNCs improve standards of living in countries they operate in\nEconomics of scale - MNCs are able to exploit economics of scale due to the large scale at which they run\nLarger customer base - MNCs can earn more profits since more people can buy their products\nRisk spreading - MNCs spread risks across overseas markets\nAvoiding trade restrictions - MNCs can avoid trade restrictions since they have manufacturing plats worldwide\nAccess to new markets - Creating branches overseas reduces transport costs\nReduce corporation tax - MNCs can choose to relocate or expand their operations to lower their corporation tax\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nUnethical practices - MNCs are prone to use cost-cutting practices which may be unethical\nCompetition with local firms - Local firms may be forced to shut down due to the MNCs ability to exploit economies of scale\nGovernment exploitation - MNCs earning a higher sales revenue than the GDP of a country gives them the ability to exploit them over important decisions\nOverreliance on MNCs - Low income countries that rely on an MNC could face major consequences should it relocate\nConflicting legal systems - MNCs would have to deal with varying legal systems, tax regulations, and environmental guidelines between different countries\nDifficult communication - A more spread out MNC is harder to manage since different branches are spread across countries, languages, cultures, and time zones\nExchange rates - Varying exchange rates (see chapter 38) across markets makes it difficult to compare sales and profit value across markets\nLocal opinions - MNCs may be unsuccessful in places where their products don’t appeal to local tastes and customs\n\n\n\n\nInternational trade - The exchange of goods and services beyond national borders\n\nExports - Products sold to overseas buyers\nImports - Foreign products bought by domestic households and firms\n\n\nFree trade - Where international trade can take place without protectionist measures\n\nAdvantages:\n\nAccess to resources - Producers and consumers gain access to products they can’t produce themselves\nLower prices - The cost of trading is reduced\nEconomies of scale - Firms operating on larger scales can benefit from economies of scale\nGreater choice - Consumers and firms have access to a larger variety of products\nIncreased market size - Firms can have higher revenues and profits to the larger consumer base\nEfficiency gains - Domestic producers are forced to improve the quality of their output due to foreign competition\nImproved international relations - Cooperation between countries is encouraged\n\n\n\n\nProtection - The use of trade barriers to restrain foreign trade\n\nMethods:\n\nTariffs - Tax paid on imports\nImport quotas - Quantitative limit on imports\nSubsidies - Financial assistance to domestic producers (to encourage competition against foreign imports)\nEmbargo - Ban on trade with a certain country\nRules and regulations - Rules regarding food safety, environmental standards, product quality, etc.\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\nInfant industries (new unestablished businesses) are safe guarded from foreign competition\nDomestic jobs are protected\nPrevents dumping\n\nDumping - Process where foreign countries sell large quantities of product at deliberately cheaper prices than local firms\n\n\nGives the government another source of revenue\nHelps overcome a balance of payments deficit (see chapter 25 and chapter 39)\nSafe guards the country from being too dependent on other countries\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nGovernment intervention distorts market signals\nIncreased costs of production due to lack of competition and incentives for innovation\nOther countries may retaliate with their own trade barriers\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 38 - Foreign exchange rates\n\nExchange rate - Price of one currency measured in terms of other currencies\n\nImportant factor during international trade (see chapter 37)\nFluctuating exchange rates can impact the demand and supply for/of products\nForeign exchange market - Marketplace where different currencies can be bought and sold.\nTwo systems:\n\nFloating\n\nCurrency values fluctuate according to market forces, without government intervention\nAppreciation - Increase in a currency’s value relative to another currency operating in a floating exchange rate system\nDepreciation - Decrease in a currency’s value relative to another currency operating in a floating exchange rate system\n\n\nFixed\n\nThe central bank buys and sells foreign currencies to ensure the value of its currency stays fixed\nUncertainties are reduced in international trade (prices of products overseas remain stable)\nDisadvantages\n\nReduces the country’s ability to use monetary policy changes\nLarge opportunity cost when maintaining the fixed rate\n\n\nRevaluation - Price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately increased\nDevaluation - Price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately decreased\n\n\n\n\nExchange rate fluctuations\n\nCauses\n\nChanges in demand for exports - Increased demand for exports increases the demand for the local currency\nChanges in demand for imports - Increased demand for imports increases the demand for foreign currency\nPrice and inflation - Domestic inflation decreases the demand for exports\nForeign direct investment - Globalisation and the expansion of MNCs causes investment overseas which requires the use of foreign currencies\nSpeculation - Foreign exchange traders move money around the world to exploit interest and exchange rates and make a profit\nGovernment intervention - Governments may choose to sell or buy large amounts of foreign currency to alter exchange rates\n\n\nConsequences: When the exchange rate increases:\n\nCustomers have greater purchasing power\nExporters are forced to sell products at higher foreign prices\nImports can buy products for cheaper\nBalance of payments may worsen (since it is harder for exporters to sell products overseas)\nEmployees in export-oriented business may lose their jobs\nLower levels of spending due to unemployment will reduce inflation\nEconomic growth falls over time due to lower export sales and higher unemployment\n\n\n\n\nEnduring strong exchange rates\n\nReducing export prices to maintain international competitiveness\nSeeking alternative suppliers for cheaper raw materials\nImproving productivity to keep average labour costs low\nSupplying more price inelastic products to make demand less sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations\nFocusing on non-price factors (like brand awareness and social responsibility)\nRelocating production processes to decrease costs of production\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 39 - Current account of balance of payments\n\nBalance of payments - The financial record of a country’s transactions with the rest of the world for a given time period, usually one year (see chapter 25)\nCurrent account - Records all exports and imports of products between a country and its trading partners, plus net income transfers from abroad\n\nFour parts:\n\nTrade in goods (or visible balance)\n\nRecord of the exports and imports of physical goods\nVisible exports - Goods sold to foreign customers, with money flowing into the domestic economy\nVisible imports - Goods bought by domestic customers from foreign sellers, with money flowing out of the economy\n\n\nTrade in services (or invisible balance)\n\nRecord of the export and import of services\nInvisible export - Services sold to foreign customers\nInvisible import - Services bought by domestic customers\n\n\nPrimary income (or investment income)\n\nRecord of the country’s net income earned from investments abroad\nExamples:\n\nProfits earned by subsidiary companies based in overseas countries\nInterest received from loans and deposits in overseas banks\nDividends earned from financial investments in overseas companies\nForeign direct investments of individuals or businesses in overseas business ventures\nMoney sent home by people working abroad\n\n\n\n\nSecondary income (or net income transfers)\n\nRecord of income transfers between residents and non-residents\nExamples:\n\nDonations to charities abroad\nForeign aid\nSubsidies or grants paid to companies based in overseas locations\nPayments of pensions to retired people now based in overseas countries\nScholarships paid to students based in overseas universities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent account deficit - Import expenditure is greater than export earnings\n\nCauses:\n\nLower demand for exports\nHigher demand for imports\n\n\nConsequences:\n\nReduced demand\nUnemployment\nLower standards of living\nIncreased borrowing\nLower exchange rate\n\n\n\n\nCurrent account surplus - Import expenditure is lesser than export earnings\n\nCauses:\n\nHigher

coasts).\nResource Abundance: Exports coal, iron ore, and gold, yet many areas are uninhabited.\nChallenges: Worker shortage, fewer taxpayers, and limited innovation due to low population.\nQuality of Life: Positive net migration and low infant mortality rate (4/1000).\n\n.Russia: Low Population Growth\n\nNatural Decline: Birth rate 11/1000 vs death rate 13.5/1000, leading to -0.25% growth in 2017.\nHigh Mortality: Life expectancy gap (women: 77.6, men: 67.5) due to smoking, alcohol, and poverty.\nDepopulation: Rural regions abandoned; 8500 villages vacated since 2002.\nGovernment Measures: Parental Glory medal and financial aid for larger families.\n\nInternational Migration: Mexico to the USA\n\nScale: Over 16 million Mexicans migrated to the USA since 1965, with 1 million annually.\nPush Factors: High crime rates (47,500 killed in 5 years), poor medical care (1 doctor per 1800).\nPull Factors: Higher literacy (99% in the USA vs 55% in Mexico) and better healthcare (1 doctor per 400).\nImpacts: USA spends heavily on border control, while Mexico faces brain drain and gender imbalance.\n\nJapan: High Dependent Population\n\nAging Society: 25% of the population is over 65; fertility rate at 1.25.\nCauses: High life expectancy (women: 89 years, men: 82 years) and fewer marriages.\nEconomic Impact: Shrinking workforce (1% yearly) and increased dependency ratio.\nPolicy Responses: Retirement age raised, and immigrant workers encouraged.\n\n.Canadian Northlands: Sparse Population\n\nExtreme Climate: Winter temperatures average -20°C; short summers hinder agriculture.\nPermafrost Issues: Frozen ground limits building and crop growth.\nTransport Barriers: Limited rail and road routes; reliance on air transport for many communities.\n\nChina:

exceptions for rural families and disabilities.\nIssues: Gender imbalance (30 million more men) and aging population (“Little Emperor Syndrome”).\n\n.France: Pro-Natalist Policy\n\nPopulation Growth: Fertility rate increased from 1.67 (1992) to 2.0 (2015).\nPolicy Incentives: Cash benefits (£675/month for a year after third child), subsidized childcare, and tax breaks.\nImpact: Workforce expanded, but higher healthcare costs and lower disposable income arose.\n\nTheme 2: The natural environment\nChristchurch Earthquake (2010-2012)\n\nMagnitude and Causes: 2010 quake had a magnitude of 7.1 at a depth of 10 km; occurred at a destructive plate boundary (Pacific and Indo-Australian plates).\nMajor Impacts: 2011 aftershock (magnitude 6.3) killed 185 people, caused $33 billion in damage, and

sea\n\nCoasts are ever-changing\nCoastal Erosion - Sea wearing away the land\n\nProcesses:\n\nHydraulic action - Water is forced into cracks in the rock by the waves. It traps air inside causing the rocks to eventually break apart.\nCorrasion (or Abrasion) - Particles of material carried by the waves crash and grind against the cliffs, causing erosion.\nAttrition - Particles carried by the waves scrape against each other causing them to be broken up into smaller and rounder particles\nSolution (or Corrosion) - The acids in seawater dissolve chalk and limestone cliffs. The resulting material produced is carried away by the waves.\n\n\nThe amount and speed of coastal erosion depends on:\n\nThe type of rocks that form the cliffs\nThe strength of the waves\nThe shape of the coastline\nHow sheltered or exposed to waves the coast is\n\n\n\n\nCoastal Deposition - Sea depositing material that has been worn away, to form new land\nTypes of waves:\n\nDestructive waves\n\nCause coastal erosion\nCreate steep beaches\n\n\nConstructive waves\n\nCause coastal deposition\nCreate gently sloping beaches\n\n\n\n\nThe strength of a wave is determined by:\n\nWave height\nWave length\n\n\nWave height and length is dependant on:\n\nThe speed and length of time a wave has been moving\nThe distance of open sea over which the wind has blown (Fetch)\n\n\n\nTopic 29: Coastal landforms created by erosion\n\nBay - Area of the coast with softer rock that has been eroded inward\nHeadland - Protruding areas of hard rock on either side of a bay\n\nWaves erode the rock face, forming cliffs\n\n\nWave-cut platform\n\nWhen waves erode a cliff, a notch (cut) may form at the bottom.\nEventually, after the notch grows big enough, the overhang above collapses down forming a wave cut platform.\n\n\nCave - When a crack in the side of a cliff is eroded by waves, it grows larger, into a cave.\nArch - A cave may grow deeper through a headland and out onto the other side. This is called an arch.\nStack - An arch may grow larger until the overhang above collapses down forming a disjointed stack.\nStump - A stack may be eroded down into a stump.\nDiscordant coastline - A coastline where different rocks meet the coast at right angles\n\nForms headlands and bays\n\n\nConcordant coastline - A coastline where different rocks are parallel to the coastline\n\nTopic 30: Coastal landforms created by deposition\n\nLongshore drift\n\nForms coastal deposition features\nTransports beach material along the coast using waves\nProcess:\n\nWhen waves don’t hit the coast at a right angle (They hit the beach from the same angle from which the prevailing wind approaches), their swash and backwash move in different directions\nThe swash is in the direction of the wave (due to the prevailing wind)\nThe backwash in the direction of the slope of the shore (due to gravity)\nThis causes the material eroded to follow a zigzag path and end up transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing wind\n\n\n\n\nSpit - A long, narrow stretch of sand and/or shingle, with one end attached to the mainland\nBar - A spit that has stretched across a bay, linking two headlands\n\nThe area of water that was cut off from the sea is called a lagoon\n\n\nTombolo - Forms when a beach or spit joins up with an offshore island\nBarrier islands - A bar that is detached from the headlands on one or both sides\nSalt marsh - A sheltered area, flooded at high tide, where silt collects behind a spit or bar\nSand dunes\n\nSand grains are trapped and deposited against an obstacle (rubbish, rocks, driftwood etc) by wind, to form dunes\nSandy beaches are usually backed by sand dunes due to strong onshore winds which transports dried out, exposed sand\n\n\n\nTopic 31: Coastal reefs and mangrove swamps\n\nCoral polyp - A tiny animal that builds a protective calcium carbonate skeleton\n\nHas a solid skeleton of limestone\nRequires:\n\nWarm water (23\\degree C to 25\\degree C)\nClear, shallow saltwater\nPlenty of sunlight\n\n\n\n\nCoral reef - Community of living organisms\n\nVery diverse ecosystem\nMade up of plants, fish and other creatures\nFound in tropical and sub-tropical seas between 30 degrees north and south of the equator\nWhere a large continuous mass of coral builds upwards and outwards from a rock base.\nThree types:\n\nFringing reef - Coral platforms grow out to sea attached to the mainland. A shallow lagoon lies above them.\nBarrier reef - Coral grows in a shallower area away from the mainland. The water between is too deep for coral to grow and forms a lagoon. These reefs form off-shore barriers along coastlines.\nAtoll - These develop around islands. Fringing reefs grow in a circle attached to the land. Sea-level rise or subsidence of the land causes the coral to grow at the height of the rising sea level to reach the light. This eventually forms a ring of coral reefs with a lagoon replacing the island in the centre.\n\n\n\n\nMangrove swamp - Area of vegetation\n\nFound along sheltered tropical coastlines and estuaries between 32\\degree N and 38\\degree S\nMade up of different species of evergreen mangrove trees and other plants.\nHome to a variety of species\n\n\nMangroves\n\nHalophytes (plants that need salty water to live)\nOnly grow in areas where:\n\nThe temperature remains above 20\\degree C\nThe seasonal temperature range doesn’t exceed 5\\degree C\nThere are no strong waves or tidal currents\n\n\nAble to withstand being covered twice a day by saltwater\nAdapted to be able to survive in these conditions\nProtect coastlines from erosion by acting as a natural barrier and flood defence\nThey filter pollutants from rivers and prevent sediment from reaching nearby coral reefs\n\n\n\nTopic 32: Hazards and opportunities\n\n\nOpportunities along coasts:\n\nFarming: Fertile land near coasts supports abundant crop production.\nIdeal for building settlements: Coastal areas are prime locations for establishing communities due to access to resources and trade.\nPorts: Coasts are strategic sites for ports, facilitating global trade and transportation.\nManufacturing (convenient for imports and exports): Coastal locations streamline the movement of goods, boosting manufacturing efficiency.\nFishing: Coastal waters are rich in marine life, supporting robust fishing industries.\nBoating, Canoeing, Kayaking: Coasts offer ideal conditions for recreational water activities like boating, canoeing, and kayaking.\nTourism: Scenic coastal regions attract tourists, driving local economies.\n\n\n\nHazards along coasts:\n\nTsunamis: Coasts are vulnerable to tsunamis, posing significant risks to life and property.\nFlooding: Coastal areas are prone to flooding, especially during storms and high tides.\nHurricanes: Coasts frequently face the destructive force of hurricanes, leading to widespread damage.\nCoastal erosion: Natural and human activities contribute to the gradual erosion of coastlines, threatening infrastructure and ecosystems.\n\n\n\nTopic 33: Managing coastal erosion\n\nReasons to protect coasts:\n\nPopulated coastal regions\nFragile ecosystems\n\n\nTwo types of protection against coastal erosion:\n\nHard engineering - Using artificial, man-made structures\n\nSea walls: Vertical barriers constructed along the coast to reflect and absorb wave energy, preventing erosion and flooding but often expensive and visually intrusive.\nGroynes: Wooden, stone, or concrete barriers built perpendicular to the shoreline to trap sand and reduce longshore drift, helping to maintain beaches but potentially causing erosion downstream.\nRock armour (Riprap): Large boulders placed at the base of cliffs or along shorelines to dissipate wave energy and protect against erosion, commonly used due to their durability and natural appearance.\nRevetments: Sloping structures made of wood, concrete, or rocks placed parallel to the shoreline to absorb wave energy and reduce erosion, typically less intrusive than sea walls but can require regular maintenance.\nGabions: Cages filled with rocks or other materials, stacked to form protective barriers that absorb wave energy and reduce erosion, often used in areas where space or budget constraints limit other options.\nOffshore breakwaters: Structures placed offshore to break the force of waves before they reach the shore, helping to reduce erosion and protect coastlines, though they can alter sediment patterns.\n\n\nSoft engineering - More sustainable, natural approach\n\nBeach nourishment: The process of adding sand or sediment to beaches to combat erosion and maintain beach width, providing a more natural appearance and enhancing recreational value, though it requires ongoing maintenance.\nManaged retreat: A strategy of allowing certain areas of the coastline to erode and flood naturally, often relocating infrastructure and communities, seen as a sustainable and long-term solution to rising sea levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study -
